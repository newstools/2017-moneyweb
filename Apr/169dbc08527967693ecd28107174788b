One of the significant market impacts of last month&#8217;s cabinet reshuffle was a a sharp rise in local bond yields. Over the course of a few days, yields on 10-year government bonds rose by over 0.7%.Just days before Pravin Gordhan was recalled from the international investor roadshow in London, 10-year government bonds were trading on yields of 8.275%. This was the lowest they had been since October 2015, just two months before Nhlanhla Nene was removed as finance minister.However, in the 10 days that followed that low point last month, yields jumped on three consecutive shocks first the news that Gordhan had been recalled from London, then the announcement that he had been fired as minister of finance, and finally S&amp;P&#8217;s decision to downgrade South Africa&#8217;s sovereign debt rating to sub-investment grade. Yields on 10-year government bonds have subsequently stabilised at around 9.0%While this is a notable decline from where they were before the upheaval, it is less so if one takes a slightly longer-term view. Bond yields started the year at around the same levels. Source: Investing.comUntil the decision to recall Gordhan, market conditions had been very favourable for bonds. The rand was strengthening, inflation was coming down, and analysts were expecting that the South African Reserve Bank may even start cutting interest rates this year.These factors were all positive for bonds, and were pushing yields lower. As yields go down, prices go up, which is favourable for investors. In fact, bonds were the top-performing local asset class in 2016 as yields fell from the highs they reached after Nene&#8217;s dismissal. They had continued to strengthen into 2017 until what happened last month.It is clear, however, that a lot of risk had remained priced into these assets, as the market reaction was nowhere near as significant as it was in December 2015. Then yields on 10-year bonds blew out by over 1.5%.What this means is that while there was a relatively large short-term impact on investors during the last week of March, it is a lot more benign if one just looks at returns from the bond market for the year to date. This is clear from local bond funds.For the three months to the end of March, only three local bond funds showed negative returns. Two of those track the South African Inflation-Linked Bond Index, the value of which has been coming down as inflation has moderated.There were also only a handful of funds that showed negative returns for March itself. By far the majority remained positive.In other words, despite the rise in yields during March, bond investors have not taken a substantial hit. The year-to-date return of the All Bond Index has been cut to 2%, but it is still the leading asset class available to domestic investors with an 11% return over the past 12 months, Old Mutual Multi-Managers pointed out in a recent note.As the below tables show, investors have so far come out relatively unscathed. The potential certainly still exists for things to deteriorate further, but for now, there is no reason to head for the exits.
