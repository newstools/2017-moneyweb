Wall Street&#8217;s major indexes closed slightly higher on Thursday but finished well off session highs as investors were nervous about upcoming talks between China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump.The leaders of the world&#8217;s two biggest economies are to greet each other at the president&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, late Thursday afternoon, kicking off a summit that will conclude with a working lunch on Friday.Investors are anxious for news on China-US trade relations and discussions on reining in North Korea&#8217;s arms program, according to market participants.&#8220;People are concerned because this could go south in a hurry because the Chinese president is a savvy politician with a lot of experience in these types of things and you have a novice (US) politician on the world stage,&#8221; said Peter Costa, President, Empire Executions Inc in New York.&#8220;The meeting is going to set the tone for what comes ahead and you don&#8217;t want the tone to be negative,&#8221; said Costa.Stocks pared gains in the late afternoon after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made comments on the meeting.From Mar-a-Lago, Tillerson said the United States will &#8220;pursue economic engagement with China that prioritizes the economic wellbeing of the American people&#8221; and would not shy away from frank discussions. Tillerson sounded like he was taking a little bit of a hardline stance with China, said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. This increases the risks that this could be a bit more confrontational than a friendly get-together between Presidents Trump and Xi. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 14.8 points, or 0.07%, to close at 20,662.95, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.54 points, or 0.19%, to 2,357.49 after reaching a session high of 2364.16 earlier in the day.The Nasdaq Composite added 14.47 points, or 0.25%, to 5,878.95.The stock market had dramatically reversed course to close lower on Wednesday after signals that the Fed would start to trim its $4.5 billion balance sheet this year.But investors reconsidered their reactions on Thursday, according to Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.&#8220;The Fed isn&#8217;t going to be indiscriminately pulling the prop out from under the market. There will be some sensitivity to what&#8217;s going on in the economy,&#8221; said Massocca.Four of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors ended lower. The energy index rose 0.8% as oil prices rose to near one-month highs. Comcast Corp was the S&amp;P&#8217;s biggest boost with a 2.1% gain to $38.13 after it announced a wireless service.Some investors are cautious ahead of the start of the corporate earnings season next week given the lofty valuations. The S&amp;P 500 index is trading at about 18 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.18-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 61 new lows.About 6.4 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges compared with the 6.8 billion average for the last 20 sessions.
