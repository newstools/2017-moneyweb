THE HAGUE &#8211; South Africa told the International Criminal Court on Friday that it believed it was under no obligation to arrest Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir during a visit two years ago even though he was subject to an ICC arrest warrant.The ICC warrant did not outweigh a South African law that grants sitting heads of state immunity from prosecution, South African legal representative Dire Tladi told judges at a hearing to discuss Pretoria&#8217;s failure to arrest al-Bashir in 2015.&#8220;There is no duty under international law and the Rome Statute to arrest a serving head of state of a non-state-party such as Omar al-Bashir,&#8221; Tladi argued.The row between South Africa and the ICC over its failure to arrest al-Bashir, who is accused of genocide and war crimes, led to Pretoria&#8217;s notifying the United Nations last year that it would withdraw from the court.Earlier this year, a South African court blocked the move over procedural issues, but the government has said it will push ahead with the withdrawal. Al-Bashir denies the charges against him. Though Sudan is not a member of the ICC, the court has jurisdiction by virtue of a 2005 UN Security Council resolution referring the conflict to the Hague-based permanent war crimes court.Friday&#8217;s hearing was called so that the court can gather information on whether it should report South Africa either to the ICC&#8217;s governing body, the Assembly of State Parties, or to the UN Security Council for non-compliance with the court.
