PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Monday he would pursue &#8220;tough and unpopular choices&#8221; to oversee economic growth and a redistribution of wealth to the country&#8217;s black majority and help grow a flagging economy.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy faces the risk of being downgraded to junk status owing to weak growth and the political upheavals after it got a reprieve last year. The economy grew by 0.3% in 2016 versus 1.3% in the previous year.
