JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, weighed down by a mix of domestic and global risk aversion ahead of consumer inflation data that traders expect to gives clues on the path of interest rates.By 0640 GMT, the rand had slipped 0.38% to 13.3450 per dollar compared to a close of 13.2950 in New York.The currency failed to take advantage of a dollar weakened by geopolitical tensions over North Korea and Syria.Low volumes of trade and weak buying interest following the long weekend also cap rand&#8217;s recent gains.Consumer price growth slowed in February to 6.3% y/y, and expected to remain at that level, according to Reuters poll. Data due out at 0800 GMT.The recent cabinet purge that saw finance minister fired and two credit downgrades to junk is still weighing, with central bank saying rand&#8217;s fall may now delay end of tightening cycle.Stocks are set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index up 0.42 percent.In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 3 basis points to 8.86%.
