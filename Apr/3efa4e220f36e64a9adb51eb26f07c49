LAGOS &#8211; Africa&#8217;s Ecobank, which operates in nearly 40 African countries, said on Tuesday a recession in Nigeria and a strong US currency had caused it to report a loss for 2016, sending its shares five percent lower.Nigeria accounts for 40% of Ecobank&#8217;s revenues and is in its second year of recession, brought on by lower oil prices which has caused chronic dollar shortages, frustrating businesses and households.&#8220;Our group revenues remained resilient despite a tough year of macroeconomic headwinds including a weaker economic environment, particularly in Nigeria, and the strengthening of our reporting currency &#8211; the US dollar,&#8221; Ecobank said.The Lagos-listed bank said its loss before tax narrowed to $131.3 million in 2016, from a loss of $205.2 million a year earlier. Its shares shed 5%, adding to a 20% fall this year. The stock fell 39% last year.Ecobank also said it planned to raise $400 million via a convertible bond issue at 6.46% above Libor and had received interest from existing investors for $300 million.
