JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand recovered on Tuesday as rising geopolitical concerns cooled the dollar, helping to relieve pressure on the local currency following credit downgrades by two agencies last week.At 0645 GMT the rand had strengthened 0.43% to 13.8950 per dollar following a close at 13.9550 on Monday in New York.The dollar was hit by increasing concerns over US tensions with North Korea and Russia which have offset expectations of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.Traders said the rand had bumped technical support just below the psychologically crucial 14.00 mark, supporting a short-term recovery heading into Easter holidays.The rand has fallen nearly 12% since March 27, when President Jacob Zuma recalled Pravin Gordhan from an overseas trip then fired him as finance minister.On Monday the central bank said political uncertainty coupled with downgrades posed a major risk to the currency.Stocks were set to open lower at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index down 0.25%.In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 fell 1 basis points to 8.985%.
