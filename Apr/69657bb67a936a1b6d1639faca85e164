JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s state-owned airline South African Airways cancelled at least 32 flights on Wednesday and has said that number could grow because of a cabin crew strike.Cabin crew at SAA went on strike in early hours of Wednesday over pay, the main union at the state-owned carrier said, disrupting domestic flights and international flights.Twenty eight of the flights cancelled were destined for domestic destinations within South Africa, while the rest were external flights, a South African Airways (SAA) official said.The carrier also said some flights had been delayed.&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about a substantial amount of revenue that has been lost in only half a day,&#8221; SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said in a video posted on the eNCA television channel&#8217;s Twitter feed.Contingency plans in place to operate with existing cabin crew staff, and passengers can check website for flight updates #SAAstrike pic.twitter.com/XslbSqVzZr&mdash; Sikelelwa Mdingi (@SikiGeyaMdingi) April 26, 2017&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping to get labour to sit down with us &#8230; so we can get everyone back to work, so that in the evening we are able to operate our international and regional flights,&#8221; Tlali said.The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) said its nearly 1 400 in-flight staff would stop work indefinitely.SAA said the strike had delayed flights out of OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg, which handles around 19 million passengers a year, and would also affect flights from its coastal airports.Zazi Nsibanyoni-Anyiam, president of the SACCA union, told Reuters that the workers, who represent around 80% of SAA&#8217;s cabin crew, had not received pay increases for six years.&#8220;We will be here until the company puts an offer on the table. We think what we are asking for is reasonable,&#8221; Nsibanyoni-Anyiam said from a picket outside OR Tambo Airport.SAA, which is technically insolvent and reliant on government debt guarantees of almost R20 billion ($1.52 billion), has been singled out by rating agencies as a threat to the country&#8217;s credit status, which was recently downgraded to &#8220;junk&#8221; by two of the big-three ratings agencies.
