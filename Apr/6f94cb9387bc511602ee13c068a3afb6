While the recent downgrade has provided much angst for middle-class South Africans, it provides employers with a unique opportunity to engage their staff around financial education. We were recently asked to speak at a small business in Gauteng, which had 15 staff members. Our brief from management was to introduce the concept of tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) and how employees could start to build up a savings nest egg in conjunction with their employers.Two aspects stood out for us:TFSA over retirement annuity over cash-in-pocketA key debate in this matter is whether an employer should offer a TFSA, a retirement annuity (RA) or if they are subsidising either of these then why not just give the employee cash in their pocket? Our argument for a TFSA is one of empowerment: Will your employees get financial independence by investing R500 a month in a TFSA? No.Unlike giving money automatically into a RA, which is deducted from their salary, what they will learn is that they can participate in investment markets and take control of their financial futures. For employers, this also removes the administrative burden of trying to administer a group pension scheme. But will R6 000 make a difference? Will R6 000 R500 per month over 12 months &#8211; make a difference to your employees? Or phrased differently: What s the point of committing R500 per month extra to an employee who will simply cash in the tax-free savings account and spend it? Using the data outlined by StatsSA, we took the average monthly earnings by employee by industry and broke it down into the table below. The figures below include bonuses and overtime payments and then we multiply by 12 months. Our last column represents the value of the R6 000 TFSA contribution to the mix:IndustryGross Monthly EarningsAnnual Earnings% impact of TFSAMining &amp; QuarryingR22 899R274 7882.18%ManufacturingR16 830R201 9602.97%Electricity, Gas and Water SupplyR38 239R458 8681.37%ConstructionR13 967R167 6043.57%Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles, motor cycles, and personal and householdgoods; hotels and restaurants industryR12 433R149 1964.02%Transport, Storage and CommunicationR22 524R270 2882.28%Financial intermediation, insurance, real estate and business servicesR19 426R233 1122.57%Community, social and personal servicesR22 199R266 3882.25%&nbsp;We believe that the above highlights two aspects:A TFSA was designed to bring new investors into the savings net by providing tax incentives to save, rather than spend every rand that comes in. Investing is a long-term game and the real benefits are only realised by building a desire to learn more about empowering yourself financially. If employers can empower their employees through products like a TFSA, then South Africa wins in the long run.
