Do you have a passion for financial trivia and can think on your feet? MoneywebTV is launching a new financial trivia quiz on 24 April and we want to see who the sharpest members of the Moneyweb community are. Over the following 4 weeks, we will be challenging viewers over 60 seconds to see how many business and finance related questions they can correctly answer.
