JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s top court said on Tuesday it will consider whether a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma should be taken by secret ballot.The rand extended its gains to 1% against the dollar after the announcement, and opposition parties said there could be a better chance that the motion, when taken, would succeed, if it was held by secret ballot.The ruling African National Congress party, which has a majority in parliament, has said it will vote against the motion, which is due on April 18. A secret ballot, however, would allow for anonymous dissent.Zuma, 74, has survived four previous no confidence votes. But opponents, led by the main opposition party Democratic Alliance, believe a recent cabinet reshuffle that led to the dismissal of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan may have angered enough ANC members to desert Zuma. &#8220;We only need 65 to 70 people from the ANC, and the secret ballot can deliver the votes to remove Zuma,&#8221; Bantu Holomisa, head of the smaller United Democratic Movement (UDM), which is also backing the no-confidence vote against Zuma, said.SUCCESS! #UDM wins round one, #ConCourt will hear our application pic.twitter.com/FsFv9p6Kx6&mdash; Bantu Holomisa (@BantuHolomisa) April 11, 2017He earlier posted a court document on his Twitter feed showing the chief justice of the Constitutional Court had given the go-ahead for the parties in the case to give their written submissions by April 21 &#8211; days after the no-confidence vote is scheduled to take place.&#8220;The debate on the no-confidence motion against Zuma will have to be postponed, we have written to the Speaker of parliament to pushed it back,&#8221; Holomisa told Reuters. &#8220;In the event that the Speaker fails to do so, we will seek a court order blocking the debate from going ahead.&#8221;The National Assembly is listed as a respondent in the case.The ANC Chief Whip&#8217;s office has rejected calls for a secret ballot for the no-confidence motion.
