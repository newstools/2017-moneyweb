South Africa&#8217;s public enterprises minister has blocked power utility Eskom from giving its former chief executive a R30 million ($2.3 million) pension payout, the government said on Sunday.Brian Molefe, who is largely credited with stabilising electricity supply following months of rolling blackouts, resigned last year after he was implicated in a report by the anti-graft watchdog on alleged influence-peddling.Molefe has denied any wrongdoing.&#8220;I have considered the Eskom board&#8217;s reasoning in formulating the proposed pension payout and cannot support it,&#8221; public enterprises minister Lynne Brown said in a statement.Brown said the payout could not be seen as a performance reward, as Molefe had already received a bonus for his role in turning Eskom around.&#8220;Nor is the proposed pension payout justifiable in light of the current financial challenges faced not only by state-owned companies, but by the country as a whole,&#8221; she said.Credit ratings agencies S&amp;P Global and Fitch downgraded South Africa to sub-investment grade this month after President Jacob Zuma removed respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Eskom&#8217;s credit rating was downgraded afterwards, a blow to the utility as it is yet to complete work on two coal-fired power stations, years behind schedule and over budget, and as it plans to build nuclear reactors.Brown ordered Eskom&#8217;s board to meet with Molefe and present her with an &#8220;appropriate pension proposal&#8221; within seven days.Molefe, now a member of parliament for the ruling African National Congress, took the reins at Eskom in 2015 as Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy endured daily power cuts, but soon implemented new maintenance policies to get more out of the nation&#8217;s fleet of ageing coal-fired power stations.
