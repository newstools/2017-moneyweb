Judge Brian Spilg has ordered former Tigon kingpin Sue Bennett to submit an outstanding affidavit to Legal Aid South Africa declaring her assets.Bennett and former Tigon MD Gary Porritt, are standing trial in the High Court in Johannesburg on more than 3 000 charges of fraud, racketeering, and various statutory crimes. The charges relate to the the collapse of the listed investment company Tigon and Progressive Systems College Guaranteed Growth (PSCGG), that was underwritten by Tigon.The pair were arrested in 2002 and 2003 respectively, but managed to delay the trial by 14 years through various applications and appeals.The trial eventually got underway late last year with both accused being unrepresented. Jack Milne, former MD of PSCGG, is the first witness, testifying about the accused s deep involvement in setting up and promoting PSCGG.Milne has not been able to take this stand so far this year, after Bennett failed to appear in court on several occasions since January 31, allegedly due to stress, major depression and burnout.In an apparent effort to reduce Bennett&#8217;s trial-related stress and move the trial along faster, Spilg has enquired about possible legal aid for her.A representative of Legal Aid South Africa informed the court on Friday that Bennett applied for legal aid last year, but the matter could not be finalised while her affidavit states that her assets were still outstanding.Spilg ordered Bennett to submit the affidavit by April 7, failing which she would be required to explain to the court her reasons for not doing so.The court is currently conducting an enquiry into Bennett s fitness to stand trial and four medical professionals were flown to Johannesburg from KwaZulu-Natal and the Southern Cape to testify in this regard on Friday.Dr Maria Dobreva, a psychiatrist from Pietermaritzburg who has recently examined and started treating Bennet, testified that she saw Bennett on February 21.Dobreva said Bennett presented as highly anxious, sweaty and clammy with a dry mouth. After about 30 minutes, she broke down and cried. She also hyperventilated.She identified Bennett s continued involvement over 15 years in litigation as well as her financial problems as her main stressors and explained a rating scale she used to come to her conclusion.Dobreva testified that Bennett was in her opinion unable to participate in court proceedings since she couldn t concentrate, pay attention to detail and solve problems. Her cognitive function was severely impaired, which would increase her anxiety and that would not be fair to her .She further testified that Bennett, at the next appointment, complained of mild nausea as a side effect of her medication, but her mood was improving. She was a bit drowsy with impaired concentration, but it was unclear how much of this was due to the known side effects of the medication and how much was due to the major depression.Dobreva s testimony in chief was interrupted so the court could hear testimony from cardiologist Dr Robert Blake, who had to return to Mossel Bay urgently. Blake testified that he examined Bennett on March 24 on request of Dr Brink. He only became aware late that same afternoon that the court ordered the examination, when the police arrived at his chambers with a subpoena.That would not have made any difference to his findings, he said.Blake testified that Bennett was stable and did not need any intervention from a cardio point of view. He said she suffered from mild hypertension, which was well controlled.He spoke to her during the appointment about what he considered a bad decision to stop taking cholesterol medication. He said Bennett thought it made her dizzy, which is not a known side effect.During cross examination Adv Anneline van den Heever, who represents Bennett in her health-related matter, accused Blake of being uninterested during the examination in the thick file Bennett carried containing medical history. He said he had what he needed, namely a report he obtained before the appointment from Bennett s treating cardiologist. He also drew her angiogram from the archive and studied it.Studying the contents of the file would not have contributed anything to the examination, he said.Van den Heever asked Blake about the relationship between stress and heart conditions, pointing out that he failed to study the psychiatric report contained in Bennett s file.He responded: I was not interested in a psychiatrist s opinion about the heart. He also denied that stress could cause a heart attack in the absence of an underlying pathology.He said while depression is common in patients after heart surgery, Bennett s surgery was seven years ago and she was unlikely to still suffer from that side effect. He said he had a suspicion there were other factors at play .Van den Heever did not finish her cross examination of Blake and he was ordered to return on April 12 when the trial will resume.Two other doctors who flew to Johannesburg to testify did not take the stand at all.During the proceedings Bennett listened attentively and often responded by giving instructions to Van den Heever.
