The Automobile Association (AA) has predicted that fuel price rises will be the first major expense to hit South Africans following the downgrade by ratings agencies to junk status, which had a negative affect on the rand.The AA s mid-month data is forecasting petrol to increase by up to 55 cents a litre in May, diesel by around 39 cents a litre, and illuminating paraffin by an estimated 41 cents a litre.&#8220;The loss of confidence by investors, and the sovereign ratings downgrades by ratings agencies Fitch and S&amp;P, have led to the rand slipping heavily against the US dollar, down from around R12.35 at the beginning of the month to its current position of around R13.40.&#8221;The association said the rand&#8217;s weakness contributed three-quarters of the expected fuel price increases at the end of the month, with hikes in international petroleum prices accounting for the balance. &#8220;However, it is a long time till month end, and there is no certainty that the impact of the downgrades has been fully priced into the economy. The picture for May could be substantially different,&#8221; the AA noted.The association said that if the rand had stayed on its previous upward course against the US dollar, it may have been strong enough to overcome the significant increases in international petroleum prices, resulting in a smaller increase in May.Tight squeeze for the SA consumerNeil Roets, CEO of debt counselling firm Debt Rescue, said the increase would have an immediate impact on the prices of virtually all other goods and services because the South African economy was largely powered by diesel and all goods transported by road would reflect this increase. Consumers are already up to their necks in debt carrying a combined debt load of R1.66 trillion. With an increase in the fuel price in May there will be a commensurate hike in the prices of almost everything else because of the heavy reliance on road transport. It&#8217;s going to make for a toxic mix that is going to severely impact the more than half of all South Africans who are three months or more behind in their debt repayments.
