JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand stretched early losses to its weakest level in nearly one week on Wednesday as traders closed positions ahead of a national holiday, slipping as much as 1.6% 13.2600 per dollar at 1145 GMT.&#8220;It&#8217;s not anything specific, but more of a technical rebound. Anything below 13.30 is still within the range,&#8221; said currency trader at Rand Merchant bank Jim Bryson.&#8220;We&#8217;d have to see a break below 12.8800 to see an momentum on the downside,&#8221; Bryson said.
