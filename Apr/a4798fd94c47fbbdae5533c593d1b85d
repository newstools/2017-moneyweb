Sporadic violence broke out in Johannesburg as more than 50,000 people marched in South Africa n cities to protest against President Jacob Zuma on Friday, demanding he quit after a cabinet reshuffle triggered the latest crisis of his presidency.Zuma&#8217;s sacking of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in the reshuffle last Thursday has outraged allies and opponents alike, undermined his authority and caused rifts in the ruling Africa n National Congress (ANC), which has governed South Africa since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.Fitch on Friday followed S&amp;P Global Ratings and downgraded South Africa to &#8220;junk&#8221;, citing Gordhan&#8217;s dismissal as one reason. S&amp;P had issued its downgrade on South Africa in an unscheduled review on Monday.In Johannesburg, police &#8220;fired rubber bullets at protesters who were attacking other protesters with stones. Four protesters sustained minor injuries,&#8221; Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesman Wayne Minaar said. Some ANC backers were trying to breach a cordon separating them from members of the opposition Democratic Alliance.Elsewhere in the city, the marches were peaceful.Tshwane marchesAbout 10,000 gathered in a field outside the Union Buildings, the site of Zuma&#8217;s offices in Pretoria, South Africa &#8216;s capital.SaveSA, a campaign comprising organisations, civil society groups, business leaders, citizens and others, organised the demonstration, with participants marching from Church Square in Tshwane to the Union Buildings.&nbsp;Watch Zwelinzima Vavi&#8217;s speech during the march:Watch Cope&#8217;s Mosiuoa Lekota speak in Tshwane. SavaSA volunteer Ethel Williams-Abrahamse said that the Gautrain wasn&#8217;t coping with the large number of supporters who were trying to travel from Johannesburg to Pretoria for the event.Williams-Abrahams says one elderly supporter suffered a heart attack at Church Square earlier on Friday morning. He was attended to by paramedics and taken to hospital.Earlier, people of all ages and races, standing around, singing the national anthem, songs and shouting &#8220;Amandla&#8221; and &#8220;Zuma must fall!&#8221; Media are on site, and there&#8217;s a SaveSA bus, Right2Know banners. Plackards state &#8220;seat of government is Union Buildings, not Saxonwold&#8221;, &#8220;South Africa is not for sale&#8221;, &#8220;Defend our Constitution&#8221;, and &#8220;No State Capture&#8221;, among others.&nbsp;Times Refreshing Worship Centre&#8217;s Pastor Jack Chokwe, who is in attendance, says he wants to show his dissatisfaction with what is happening in government, where excellence is being punished and mediocracy and ineptitude rewarded. He says he is taking a stand against state capture and corruption and that today is about sending a message to the ruling party and the president &#8211; who he calls &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; since the Constitutional Court found him to have contravened the Constitution.He says Zuma is looting the state with the Guptas and the Russians and South Africans are suffering the consequences in the form of the credit downgrade that will result in fewer jobs, higher interest rates and less money to support the poor. Syriana Maesela, 65, a retiree was on her way by train to Pretoria to join the march carrying a South African flag.&#8220;I am marching to get the ANC to take us seriously and respect our wishes by letting the president go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are unhappy about his leadership because he does not seem to care about the people.&#8220;The irony is I did the same thing in 1976 when I was a student. I also marched then,&#8221; she said, referring protests against the apartheid regime.There is a moderate police presence and a police helicopter flying overhead from time to time.The Presidency has stated that it is not opposed to the SaveSA march to the Union Buildings.Johannesburg marchesMmusi Maimane, leader of opposition party the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, held a rally of more than 10,000 people &#8211; from the Westgate Transport Hub to Mary Fitzgerald Square &#8211; that was calm, a few streets from the scene of the violence. Some held placards saying &#8220;Fire Zuma&#8221;. Many marchers wore blue DA T-shirts &#8211; with some bussed in from other areas. &#8220;Our country is in crisis,&#8221; Maimane, who wore a bullet-proof vest under his shirt after the DA said it had received threats to the protest&#8217;s leaders, said. &#8220;The time to act is now.&#8221;&#8220;We are unhappy about his leadership because he does not seem to care about the people,&#8221; said Syriana Maesela, 65, a retiree carrying a South Africa n flag. &#8220;The irony is I did the same thing in 1976 when I was a student. I also marched then,&#8221; she said, referring protests against the apartheid regime.About 300 members of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) gathered outside Luthuli House in Johannesburg from early on Friday morning, ahead of the DA march. Military veterans said they were guarding Luthuli house against protestors, who want Zuma to resign following his controversial cabinet reshuffle. Some clad in the yellow, green and gold colours of the ANC also danced, waving placards emblazoned with the words: &#8220;I&#8217;m prepared to die for my ANC&#8221; and &#8220;Hands off our President&#8221;.&#8220;They are free to march freely but not to try and remove a government that was elected democratically,&#8221; said Kebby Maphatsoe, the head of the veterans group and also Deputy Minister of Defence and Military Veterans.&#8220;Let them wait for 2019 and we will take them on, but the ones that want to remove it undemocratically, MKMVA will rise up to the occasion.&#8221;The ANCYL had warned members of the DA that they will be met by &#8220;sjamboks and other weapons&#8221; if their march extended to Luthuli House. The DA initially planned to march to Luthuli House but opted to reroute their march to Newtown in Johannesburg.Several city residents stood along the roads, waving placards demanding that Zuma step down.&#8220;This president is mishandling the presidency and he should leave office,&#8221; said Graham Fish, 62.A &#8220;holding hands&#8221; picket was due to take place in Cape Town, where motorists hooted in support of the march holding up South African flags.In SandtonThere are at least a few thousand protesters in Sandton, walking from Rivonia Road to Grayston Drive. They are chanting &#8220;Zuma must Fall&#8221;, and singing the national anthem, with cars hooting in support. Asked why they were protesting, two people Moneyweb spoke to said even if nothing happens, it&#8217;s a show of unity and of their discontent with Zuma and those with him.Another protester Moneyweb spoke to said they were marching because they really wanted to get rid of Jacob Zuma, that he&#8217;s poison to the country and they were fighting for freedom and unity for everybody. She said we need for everybody to unite.&nbsp;Land first: A small group of BLF protested on Grayston Drive, drawing attention to land reform.A large group of youth gathered in Sandton, within the march. Youth protestors protestors gather at the corner of Grayston Drive and Rivonia Rd SAPS keeping an eye, while BLF demonstrates. &nbsp;Durban&nbsp;Meanwhile, members of the ANC Youth League gathered in downtown Durban, singing &#8220;Awuleth&#8217;umshini wami&#8221;, a song popularised by Zuma, which means &#8220;bring me my gun&#8221; and held placards supporting the president.See the anti-Zuma protest here:About 4,000 people were also marching in the coastal city of Durban, the main city in the KwaZulu Natal province, an ANC stronghold.&#8220;We need to unite and fight this corruption,&#8221; said Michelle Fortune, 48, a manager who declined to say where she works. She wore a South Africa n flag bandana.Watch the pro-Zuma march here:&nbsp;Cape TownIn Cape Town, motorists hooted in support of the march as about 10,000 people gathered at various points in the city, including outside parliament.&#8220;It&#8217;s not simply a question of his removal. It is about the renewal of the ANC and democracy,&#8221; said Gerrald Ray, 56, a business strategist.Market reactionThe rand weakened slightly after Fitch&#8217;s announcement. The currency has tumbled more than 11 percent since March 27, when Zuma ordered Gordhan to return home from overseas talks with investors, days before firing him.&#8220;The bottom line is we are paying for the consequences of the political regime that has lost direction,&#8221; said Gary van Staden, analyst at NKC Africa n Economics. The downgrade will add to pressure on Zuma to leave office, he said.Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note that although there was mounting opposition to Zuma &#8220;we think that the most likely outcome is still that Mr. Zuma will decide the timing of his own exit.&#8221;&nbsp;Follow the protests:
