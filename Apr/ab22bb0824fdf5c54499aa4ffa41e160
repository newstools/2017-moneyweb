JOHANNESBURG Imagine going to the doctor with an illness, but to leave with a prescription for moderately intense aerobic exercise for 30 minutes, five times a week.As the medical industry shifts its focus to preventative interventions rather than treatment to get people healthier and reduce medical costs, doctors may increasingly be incentivised to engage patients on their exercise routine.Discovery Vitality on Wednesday announced that it has expanded its Vitality Active Rewards programme which incentivises members to get active and healthier to doctors.The programme will reward doctors for their own personal engagement and getting active, while also considering how their patients are doing and how they digitally engage with them.Dr Maurice Goodman, chief medical officer at Discovery Health, says as the leaders in the healthcare system, doctors have a critical role to play. Healthier doctors are more productive, deliver better quality healthcare and are more effective in prescribing wellness.The development comes amidst overwhelming scientific evidence of the benefits of exercise in preventing chronic or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cancer, heart attacks, strokes, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. Yet, despite significant advances in medical and pharmaceutical technology, South Africa has been unable to effectively address the growing incidence of these illnesses.According to data from the World Economic Forum and Willis Towers Watson, there has been a significant increase in South Africa s burden of disease with regard to NCDs over the past 25 years, particularly as far as diabetes is concerned.Source: World Economic Forum, Willis Towers Watson, Discovery Health (DALY stands for disability-adjusted life year, a measure of the overall disease burden. According to the World Health Organisation, one DALY is effectively one lost year of healthy life.) A paper released by Statistics South Africa earlier this year, shows that NCDs are now the leading cause of mortality in South Africa.Prof Martin Schwellnus, director of the Institute for Sport, Exercise Medicine and Lifestyle Research at the University of Pretoria, says broadly speaking people who exercise regularly have a roughly 50% less chance of developing any of the chronic diseases.But getting patients involved in the process of preventing NCDs through a healthy diet, exercise and lifestyle can be difficult.Dr Elijah Nkosi, CEO of the South African Medical and Dental Practitioners, says the level of activity varies among patients, but generally most people do not exercise.Yet, he has personally seen positive outcomes following discussions with patients about the issue. Some patients who were previously taking anti-depressants saw such an improvement in their health after adding exercise to their routine, that they could stop taking the medicine.But there are also indications that there may not be enough emphasis on exercise emerging from the medical profession itself. The way the medical system is set up may also not be conducive to prescribing an exercise routine if general practitioners see patients for 10 or 15 minutes on average.Dr David Jankelow from the South African Heart Association s Johannesburg branch says cardiologists see a lot of patients with serious heart disease, who suffered heart attacks or who had bypass surgery. When these patients come for a check-up it is easy to take their blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and weight readings, but to get a clear sense of the overall risk is very difficult. We also tend to end up in a cycle of doing more tests, more stress tests, more angiograms, more procedures and really should be focusing on more prevention of non-communicable and vascular disease. Cardiac rehabilitation research shows that patients who have heart failure, who have had a heart attack, or who have a bypass or stent, are much better off if they get advice on their diet, psychological encouragement and slowly start to get moving, he adds. As clinicians we focus on the nitty-gritty of daily practice and we don t sit back and look at the bigger picture sometimes. Only a minority of patients are willing to consult a biokineticist or dietician during cardiac rehabilitation. It is much easier to ask for a prescription than to make a meaningful lifestyle change. Although there is a perception that people who are sick should refrain from doing exercise and doctors may be concerned about prescribing some activity in these situations, the sickest people are the ones that could benefit the most from getting active, Schwellnus says.However, the prescription for activity must be appropriate to the patient and therapy should be individualised, says Dr Sundeep Ruder, clinical endocrinologist at Life Fourways Hospital.
