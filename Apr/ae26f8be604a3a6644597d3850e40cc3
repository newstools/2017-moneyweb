The decision by S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade South Africa s foreign currency debt rating to sub-investment grade has pushed yields on South African 10-year government bonds to new highs for the year to date.In early trade on Tuesday, yields rose as high as 9.180% which is a level last seen in November 2016. Around midday, they had come back a little to 9.015%.The yield on the 10-year paper was at 8.270% in the week before former finance minister Pravin Gordhan was recalled from an international investor roadshow. However, news of that recall, his subsequent dismissal and now the announcement from S&amp;P have seen yields expand by just under 75 basis points.&nbsp;Source: Investing.comThis short-term spike in yields is the largest since Nhlanhla Nene was dismissed as finance minister in December 2015. Then bond yields blew out by 172 basis points.Equity market reactionThe FTSE/JSE All Share Index made early gains on Tuesday, as the weaker rand supported much of the market.
