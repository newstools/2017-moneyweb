He said the minibus driver was killed, while the truck driver survived.Even though it is Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy with a modern road network, South Africa has a dire road safety record. Road deaths rose to 235 during this year&#8217;s Easter weekend compared with 156 fatalities last year, transport officials said earlier on Friday.
