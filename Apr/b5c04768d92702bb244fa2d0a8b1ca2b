Three former members of South African President Jacob Zuma s administration resigned as lawmakers for the ruling African National Congress before this month s debate of a motion of no confidence in the nation s leader.Former transport minister Dipuo Peters, Tina Joemat-Pettersson, who was the energy minister, and ex-deputy finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas resigned as members of parliament, effective March 31, the National Assembly said in emailed statements. Zuma fired Peters, Joemat-Pettersson and Jonas in a cabinet reshuffle announced shortly after midnight the same day.By resigning immediately after their removal, the former ministers and Jonas may ensure they receive pensions according to their previous positions in the administration instead of what they would receive as lawmakers should they retire later.While opposition leaders have urged ANC lawmakers to vote according to their conscience in the April 18 vote in the National Assembly, where the ANC has a 62% majority, party secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said on Wednesday they won t oppose Zuma. The rules of parliament don t allow for a secret ballot.The ANC is allowed to fill those seats before the vote, according to parliamentary rules. The motion requires a simple majority of lawmakers at the time of the vote, provided there is a quorum, for it to carry or be rejected, parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mothapo said by phone from Cape Town. Zuma s decision to fire Pravin Gordhan as finance minister and make 19 other changes to his administration drew widespread criticism, prompted S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade the nation s credit rating to junk and weakened the rand. 2017 Bloomberg
