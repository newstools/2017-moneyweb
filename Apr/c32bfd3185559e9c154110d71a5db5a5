A national wholesale open-access network, as proposed in government s ICT policy white paper, is the best way of bringing down the price of broadband in South Africa. However, the white paper has problems that, if not addressed, will lead the industry to court.These are the views of Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos, who speaks in detail in this podcast interview with TechCentral editor Duncan McLeod about the state of South Africa s telecommunications industry, with specific reference to ICT policy. In the podcast, Dos Santos talks about the planned recapitalisation of Cell C, how the deal with Blue Label Telecoms, which is buying 45% of the company, came about, and touches on its recent financial results.The conversation also covers network neutrality and mobile termination rates, which Dos Santos believes should be cut to zero, plus plenty more. It s essential listening for everyone interested in the telecoms space in South Africa.This article was first published on TechCentral. To access the original, please click here.&nbsp;
