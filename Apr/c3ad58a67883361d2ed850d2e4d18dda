PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Tuesday the credit rating downgrade by S&amp;P meant the government had to pay even greater focus on growing the economy, and that he would address the issues raised by the rating agencies.#Gigaba: it&#8217;s very much possible to achieve inclusive growth (even in difficult economic conditions). We are going to try to do our best. Karyn Maughan (@karynmaughan) April 4, 2017&nbsp;Gigaba said South Africa&#8217;s rand-denominated debt was still rated as investment grade and that the government&#8217;s fiscal policy remained unchanged despite the switch in finance ministers following the reshuffle last week. S&amp;P cut the country&#8217;s credit rating to BB+ with a negative outlook from BBB- in an unscheduled review, saying the dismissal of respected Pravin Gordhan as finance minister raised the risk a damaging policy shift.Gigaba said he would focus on accelerating reforms to corporate governance at the country&#8217;s ailing state-owned companies following a downgrade to &#8220;junk&#8221; by S&amp;P.Gigaba said he had spoken to the other major rating firms Fitch and Moody&#8217;s to reassure them about his plans to keep fiscal policy unchanged and deal with political instability.#Gigaba: there are a whole range of factors that led to downgrade. Certainly Minister Gordhan doesn&#8217;t want us looking backward. #junkstatus Karyn Maughan (@karynmaughan) April 4, 2017&nbsp;
