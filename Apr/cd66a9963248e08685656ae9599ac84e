South Africa&#8217;s Competition Commission said on Sunday that it had asked the Competition Tribunal to fine construction materials group Afrimat for allegedly &#8220;abusing its dominance by charging excessive prices.&#8221;&#8220;The Commission is seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that Afrimat &#8230; must pay the maximum fine allowable by law which amounts to 10% of its annual turnover in South Africa as well as its exports from the country,&#8221; the Commission said in a statement.A unit of Afrimat supplies the main ingredient in clinker bricks, which are mostly used in the construction of low-cost housing units, known as RDP houses in South Africa.&#8220;The Commission has found that Afrimat abused its dominant position from 2012 until at least 2016 (the conduct may be ongoing) by charging clinker bricks&#8217; manufacturers excessive prices to the detriment of consumers,&#8221; the Commission said.Afrimat could not immediately be reached for comment.
