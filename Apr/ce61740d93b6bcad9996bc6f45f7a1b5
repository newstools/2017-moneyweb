CAPE TOWN &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s former public administration minister, Ngoako Ramathlodi, has resigned his seat in Parliament, the fourth former member of Cabinet to quit after being removed in a recent Cabinet reshuffle, the ruling ANC party said on Wednesday.The Office of the ANC Chief Whip said Ramathlodi&#8217;s resignation is effective March 31 2017.It added: &#8220;Comrade Ramathlodi has served as Minister and MP with absolute distinction and dedication. We are confident that he will continue serving the movement in other capacities in future.&#8221;&nbsp;President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s sacking of his finance minister in the cabinet reshuffle shook South African markets, undermining his authority and threatening to split the African National Congress (ANC) that has governed since the end of apartheid. Ramatlhodi formerly served as deputy minister of correctional services from November 2010 to May 2014; as minister of mineral resources from May 2014 to September 2015, and then as minister of public service and administration.He has been a member of Parliament since 2004.
