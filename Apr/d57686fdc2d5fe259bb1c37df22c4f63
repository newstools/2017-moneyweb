Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Fed balance sheetThe minutes of the Federal Open Markets Committee March meeting show that most officials agree that they will begin reducing the size of the bank&#8217;s $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year. Traders are betting that the reduction in bond holdings will have a monetary effect, which may slow the pace of interest rate rises for the rest of 2017. The minutes also showed that some members are getting worried about stock valuations.Cohn and banks, Trump and ChinaWhite House economic adviser Gary Cohn said he supports a policy that could radically reshape Wall Street by separating their consumer-lending businesses from investment banks in a throwback to Glass-Steagall, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meanwhile, Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later today in a test of the US president&#8217;s pre-election promise to do better deals with China. On the agenda will be everything from trade to the threat posed by North Korea, with negotiating teams on both sides having plenty to work through.Draghi restatesEuropean Central Bank president Mario Draghi said that inflation in the euro area is not strong enough for a shift to tighter monetary policy. The euro dropped against the US dollar following his dovish comments and was trading at $1.0668 by 5:32am Eastern Time. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said that faster UK inflation alone would not force a rate hike there.
