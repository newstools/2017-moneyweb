JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Cabin crew at South African Airways (SAA) went on strike on Wednesday over pay benefits, the top union at the state-owned carrier said, disrupting domestic flights and threatening to extend the walkout to international routes.The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) said its nearly 1 400 in-flight workers would down tools indefinitely.SAA said the strike had already delayed flights out of OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg, which handles around 19 million passengers a year, and would also affect flights from its coastal airports.Zazi Nsibanyoni-Anyiam, president of the SACCA union, told Reuters that the workers, who represent around 80% of SAA&#8217;s cabin crew, had not received pay increases for six years.&#8220;We will be here until the company puts an offer on the table. We think what we are asking for is reasonable,&#8221; Nsibanyoni-Anyiam said from a picket outside OR Tambo Airport. SAA, which is technically insolvent and reliant on government debt guarantees of almost R20 billion ($1.52 billion), has been singled out by rating agencies as a threat to the country&#8217;s credit status, which was recently downgraded to &#8220;junk&#8221; by two of the big-three ratings agencies.($1 = R13.1375)
