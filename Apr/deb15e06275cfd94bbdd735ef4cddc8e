JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) is expected to slightly lower its summer maize forecast when it gives its third estimate next week but a bumper harvest is still seen, a Reuters survey of four analysts and institutions showed on Thursday. The CEC, which gives its next forecast on Tuesday, is seen pegging the harvest at 14.175 million tonnes, about 1% lower than its previous estimate of 14.32 million tonnes.This would still be over 82% more than the 7.78 million tonnes reaped last year, when drought hit the crop, pushing up food prices and inflation. The range was 13.5 to 14.6 million tonnes.This season&#8217;s crop has benefited hugely from good rains but Wandile Sihlobo, an economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber, said yields might be depressed slightly in parts of the country&#8217;s maize belt where plantings were late and recent rainfall has been scattered.The white maize contract due in July was 1.15% lower on Thursday at R1 879 a tonne, around 65% lower than record peaks of over R5 000 a tonne scaled early last year during the drought.
