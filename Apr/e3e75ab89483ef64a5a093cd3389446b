NASTASSIA ARENDSE: The Grindstone Accelerator is a structured entrepreneurship development programme that assists high-growth, innovation-driven companies to become sustainable and fundable. Throughout this series we ll be sitting down with each of the ten companies selected for the programme. Today we have Gabriel Verhoef, who is the CEO of Master Grade IT. Tell us about your story, how did the company start?GABRIEL VERHOEF: The company started about 20 years ago and I joined about 17 years ago, I sold my previous business and I was looking for something that would be in demand for a long time and I believe in the immense empowerment that education provides, so that s how it started.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: What exactly does Master Grade IT do?GABRIEL VERHOEF: We educate people, we provide training to individuals, business and government on information systems and technology. The model is highly adaptive, which means that we allow for traditional methods of instruction in an instructor-led environment, either at our facility or at the client s premises, e-learning or online learning and our own mentored learning environment.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Where do you see your industry going in the next few years based on research you may have done or the stats you have seen?GABRIEL VERHOEF: Nastassia, IT is pervasive, it is engrained in almost every aspect of modern life and it is constantly changing. New technology and applications create a demand for understanding and we are perfectly positioned downstream to act as a conduit between software development by organisations like Microsoft and the end user. So I don t see us not being in demand, in fact, I see the demand increasing.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: What would you say has been the most challenging or difficult decision you ve had to make?GABRIEL VERHOEF: I had to de-franchise from a franchise model approximately two and a half years ago and against the advice of everyone I decided to de-franchise and to possibly forfeit a lot of goodwill built up over something like 14, 15 years but it seemed to have paid off.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: What would you say is the most satisfying moment thus far in the business?GABRIEL VERHOEF: De-franchising and going on my own, definitely.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: So for the Moneyweb audience who are listening to this conversation what is the specific lead or need that the audience can assist you with?GABRIEL VERHOEF: We are based in Cape Town at the moment and what we do is a lot of what is called onsite training in Johannesburg, but the demand for a centre in Gauteng has become overwhelming, which necessitates an increase in our geographical footprint. I need space in Johannesburg and I need a friendly and accommodating lease. I would love to have the space there to start there, albeit not big but I definitely see that the demand increase exceeds the demand in Cape Town by about 60%.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Based on what your company does, if you could have one person or an organisation listening to this interview who would you want it to be?GABRIEL VERHOEF: As I said previously, IT is pervasive, everyone needs varying degrees of exposure to this discipline in order to either maintain their current employment or secure future employment or to be considered for advancement. Every employer by implication then also needs to ensure that his or her employees function as efficiently and effectively, so definitely both individuals and organisations.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: How does the Moneyweb audience start a conversation with you, is there a website or email address where they can reach you?GABRIEL VERHOEF: We have a very successful website www.mastergradeit.co.za and anyone is welcome to email me at [email&#160;protected] or just call us on 021-419-3213.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: I m sure you ve heard of a lot of accelerator programmes that are out there, what attracted you to the Grindstone Accelerator?GABRIEL VERHOEF: You know how these things happen. Someone mentioned it over a glass of wine somewhere, I approached them and was lucky enough to be part of them.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: If you could have one piece of advice that you d like to share for other entrepreneurs what would it be?GABRIEL VERHOEF: It s a tough space, Nastassia, I would definitely recommend that people get help. There s a very good reason why larger organisations have non-executive directors on their board, one of the main responsibilities of a non-executive director is to ensure that a properly designed strategy is executed as planned and that they monitor compliance. In my opinion there is tragically a huge gap in the market for this type of function for smaller enterprises. It s lonely at the top and we all rise to some level of the Peter principle without regular advice and feedback from some form of knowledgeable external stakeholder. So I would definitely say get help and get regular feedback. Secondly, and something that applies to me, identify your risk appetite, we all have varying degrees and different risk appetites, which impacts largely on our strategy and then just manage that risk.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Gabriel, we ll have to leave it there, thank you so much for your time.GABRIEL VERHOEF: Thank you very much for calling me, it was nice to have spoken to you.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: That is Gabriel Verhoef, the CEO of Master Grade IT.
