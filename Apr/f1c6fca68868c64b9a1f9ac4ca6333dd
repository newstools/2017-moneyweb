The 12th of March 2017 will be remembered in the history of this country as a day that brought unprecedented unity and co-operation amongst erstwhile political opponents.In one sense, you could say President Zuma has been a unifier of enormous proportions, because the only reason these parties have come together is to call for his dismissal. Listen to the interview with Cope&#8217;s Mosiuoa Lekota on the importance of a secret ballot:While virtually every political party bar the ANC was present, this was the EFF&#8217;s show and they demonstrated they have become masters at mass mobilisation and organisation.As the EFF&#8217;s CIC, Julius Malema said, this is just the beginning. Rolling mass action is going to be rolled out to every province and major city of the land, until Jacob Zuma is no longer President. &#8220;A revolution doesn&#8217;t happen in a few hours. It takes time. But it has started, it&#8217;s on.&#8221;Mosiuoa Lekota Leadership of the EFF gather before addressing the crowd gathered at Church Square, Pretoria The Democratic Alliance&#8217;s Phumzile van Damme addresses the crowd at Church Square, Pretoria. CIC of the EFF, Julius Malema. He gave very strict instructions to the crowd before the march began for protestors to follow the route and be disciplined. Many in the audience sent their regards to the President on his birthday. While virtually every political party in the country was represented at the march, this was the EFF&#8217;s show, and boy, do they know how to turn it on. Like South Africa&#8217;s very own Game of Thrones, all the &#8220;armies&#8221; united from different parts of the city to descend on the Union Buildings. The leadership of the various political parties and civic organisations united arm-in-arm to lead the march to the Union Buildings. Represented here: EFF, APC, COPE, UDM, DA , SaveSA, IFP (And youth league), and ACDP. A range of posters were on display, many of which the President wouldn&#8217;t enjoy. While the police were present, the march was conducted in good spirits and there were no confrontations with the security contingent. The crowd that gathered at the Union Buildings was estimated to be in the region of 120 000 by the SAPS. With a sense of humour South Africans possess, who can deny us?Mosiuoa LekotaLeadership of the EFF gather before addressing the crowd gathered at Church Square, PretoriaThe Democratic Alliance&#8217;s Phumzile van Damme addresses the crowd at Church Square, Pretoria.CIC of the EFF, Julius Malema.

Time to go home!Many of the &#8220;coffins&#8221; for the President became sacrificial items at the bonfire that occurred at the culmination of the day&#8217;s events. Julius Malema made a point of explaining how the credit downgrade will affect the price of bread &#8211; and would affect the &#8220;poorest of the poor.&#8221;Many of the &#8220;coffins&#8221; for the President became sacrificial items at the bonfire that occurred at the culmination of the day&#8217;s events.Julius Malema made a point of explaining how the credit downgrade will affect the price of bread &#8211; and would affect the &#8220;poorest of the poor.&#8221;Not all bus drivers were on strike.
