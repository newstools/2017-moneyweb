JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand scaled a three-week high against a weakening dollar on Thursday, boosted by slowing inflation and reassurances by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba that he had no plans to nationalise mines and banks.At 0650 GMT, the rand had gained 0.36% to 13.2300 per dollar, its firmest since March 31, compared to a close of 13.2775 overnight in New York.The currency plunged as low as 13.9800 per dollar on April 10 after a cabinet reshuffle prompted downgrades by ratings agencies S&amp;P and Fitch.&#8220;Global short-term pressures on the rand have eased,&#8221; RMB Global Markets analyst John Cairns said in a note.On Wednesday, data showed March inflation slowed to 6.1% and Gigaba moved to reassure investors after one of his advisors called for nationalisation of banks and mines.&#8220;It is too early to say that the market has found a new post-downgrade level. And there remains a lot on the political front that will shock,&#8221; Cairns added.Stocks were set to open flat at 0900 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index down 0.05%.In fixed income, bonds firmed as the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 2 basis points to 8.750%.
