JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African President Jacob Zuma pledged on Thursday to redistribute wealth in the economy to poor black people as part of a policy he calls &#8220;radical socio-economic transformation&#8221;. &#8220;We mean the fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of South Africans, especially the poor,&#8221; Zuma said in a speech to members of local government.Zuma&#8217;s fresh &#8220;transformation&#8221; pledge has been criticised by opponents who say it is a populist attempt to win votes and vague rhetoric similar to many promises made since the end of apartheid in 1994.
