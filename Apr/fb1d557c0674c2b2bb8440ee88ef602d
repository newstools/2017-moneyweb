Yields on South African dollar bonds jumped to the highest this year after Fitch Ratings became the second company to cut the country s credit assessment to junk, triggering sales by some funds tracking investment-grade debt indexes.President Jacob Zuma plunged South Africa into a political crisis when he fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan March 31, prompting a drop in the rand and triggering a downgrade to junk from S&amp;P Global Ratings. The move by Fitch means the country s foreign-currency debt will now be considered sub-investment grade, and brought the local-currency assessment to the cusp of junk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another downgrade in just one week is a major blow, said Piotr Matys, an emerging-market strategist at Rabobank in London. It means that even those foreign investors that are still relatively optimistic about the long-term outlook for South Africa may have to trim their exposure. In the short term, in the coming weeks, we will probably witness a wave of capital outflows. Fitch reduced the foreign-currency and local-currency ratings to BB+, the highest non-investment grade, from BBB-. The outlook is stable.Yields on benchmark dollar bonds due October 2028 rose seven basis points to 5.16%, widening the premium over US Treasuries by 16 basis points to 296 points. The rand declined as much as 0.6% before rallying after US payrolls numbers missed estimates. The currency traded 0.2% stronger at 13.7329 per dollar by 2:38pm in Johannesburg. 2017 Bloomberg
