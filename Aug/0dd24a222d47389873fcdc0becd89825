I recently attended a board meeting of an independent financial advisor, and the following graph was included in the board pack:With acknowledgement to DDTC (Cited: Asisa Multi Asset Categories Cumulative Return, www.morningstar.com, July 27, Bellville)The Asisa average for SA Multi Asset High Equity funds over the last 12.5 years makes for interesting reading.This particular category in the Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) space averaged 363.3, which means that if a R100 was invested on December 31, 2004, a client would see an amount of R363.30 returned to him on the June 30, 2017, that is net of costs, out- and underperformance of asset classes, as well as stock-picking contributions or reductions from performance, over this period. This is an annual yield of 10.87% per annum. Cash returned 240.50 (7.27% pa) index points, bonds 261.68 (8% pa) and property a staggering 851.20 (18.67% pa) over this 12.5 year period.Before I go on, certain further details need to be explained and that refers to the classification by Asisa of the various multi-asset funds. Currently, there are three categories in the prudential fund (pension/retirement) space, meaning the funds invest in accordance with the regulations of the Pension Fund Act, in particular Regulation 28 of the Pension Fund Act. These categories are called the SA Multi Asset Low Equity, SA Multi Asset Medium Equity and SA Multi Asset High Equity, the difference being a maximum investment in equities of 40%, 60% and 75% respectively.With this in mind, modelling with these and other historic numbers, the average performance of the SA Multi Asset High Equity fund makes up some interesting reading.The JSE returned 583.70, a yield of 15.16% per annum. Taking costs into account for a fund that attempted to track the performance of this index would result in 46.3 points being subtracted from the JSE All Share Total Return Index, which brings us to 537.38 index points. This means, we lower the JSE All Share Total Return Index from 15.16% per annum to 14.4% per annum, a number of 0.76% per annum is allowed for costs and underperformance, in this model.In order to have an average index return of 363.30 and assuming:Therefore, if all the below average SA Multi Asset Equity High funds invested in a JSE All Share Equity Index fund, having costs of 0.76% per annum, the performance lift on the equity return would have been from 445.17 to 537.38 an enhancement of 20.71% in the equity performance. This would have come with less risk of underperformance and much less volatility.If one constructed a portfolio with just two asset classes 12.5 years ago, having 75% in the JSE All Share Index (the maximum equity exposure in a Prudential fund) and 25% in the property index (the maximum), your portfolio would have yielded 615.84, which is an annual return of 15.65% per annum, higher than the JSE All Share Index Total return, which is a far cry from the average of 363.30! This obviously comes in hindsight.Volatility and risk of underperformance/cost effectsCompare the above with a lower than average risk allocation of 60% equity and 40% cash allocation in index funds, which would have yielded 418.63 (12.14% pa) (60% x 537.38 + 40% x 240.50) and the Asisa industry average of 363.3 (10.87%).Performance tableEquity index*CashProperty indexTotal index pointsOutperformance /(underperformance) of Asisa averageBottom Industry Performer240.99-33.67%Asisa industry average363.30Asset allocation 160%40%418.6315.23%Asset allocation 275%25%463.1627.49%Top industry performer524.1944.29%Asset allocation 375%10%15%554.7752.70%Asset allocation 465%10%25%586.1561.34%*Equity Index value is after costs of 0.76% per annum.With a reasonable element of certainty, the following can be deduced:By investing in index funds, with low cost structures, the risks of underperformance due to bad stock picking as well as higher costs for this active management, can be substantially reduced. As indicated above, this will result in a significant increase in performance for the average investor over time.This begs the question, can the average investor, through his/her savings for retirement, afford such significant underperformance over such an extended period (12.5 years)?Why are more investors not opting for prudential funds utilising indexes as its asset classes but with active asset class selection and allocation (bonds, equities, cash, properties or international assets) by professional fund managers?Pankie Kellerman is group CEO at Gryphon Asset Management.
