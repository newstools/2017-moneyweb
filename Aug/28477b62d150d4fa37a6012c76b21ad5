The Department of Labour has started a review to inspect 72 JSE-listed firms to ensure compliance with employment equity laws, it said on Thursday.South Africa&#8217;s employment equity legislation aims to remove unfair discrimination and accelerate diversity in workplaces as the government seeks to redress the race-based policies of apartheid which ended in 1994 when the ruling African National Congress came to power.The department said any company which breached employment equity laws could face a fine of R1.5 million or be liable for criminal prosecution to enforce compliance.
