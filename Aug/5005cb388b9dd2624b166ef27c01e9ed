South African President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s survival in a parliamentary no-confidence vote will not impact the country&#8217;s downgrade-threatened credit rating, the S&amp;P Global agency said on Wednesday.Zuma survived a no-confidence motion against him in on Tuesday by winning 198 votes to the opposition&#8217;s 177 votes as African National Congress lawmakers rallied to his support, though some members did vote against him.&#8220;Failure of no-confidence vote means status quo remains,&#8221; S&amp;P&#8217;s primary analyst for South Africa Gardner Rusike told Reuters.&#8220;The situation remains within our base-case scenario which is desirable (for maintaining the current BB+ rating with a negative outlook).&#8221;Rusike said, however, that political risks remain elevated, carrying risks for the South African economy.The sizable number of ANC parliament members voting with the opposition, was &#8220;unexpected&#8221; and showed divisions within the party, Rusike said. That could impact the December 2017 ANC elective conference and perhaps even national elections in 2019.Rusike also said a proposed near $1 billion bailout of South Africa&#8217;s national airline, South Africa Airways, was unlikely to cause a further rating downgrade.&#8220;This bailout (South African Airways) is taken into account at the level of moderate contingent liabilities,&#8221; he said.A key issue, especially for South Africa&#8217;s local currency debt rating, is the recent talk about nationalising the country&#8217;s respected central bank.Local South African debt still carries an investment grade rank and loss of this could see more than $10 billion flee the country&#8217;s rand-denominated debt markets&#8220;We do believe that South Africa has a deep domestic debt market and we also believe the central bank is independent and has credibility to implement monetary policy &#8211; as well the government&#8217;s fiscal flexibility.&#8221;&#8220;If either of these factors were to weaken, that is what could potentially result in equalising the foreign currency rating and the local currency rating,&#8221; Rusike said.&#8220;We do believe that it may not be implemented either in the near term or the medium-term.&#8221;
