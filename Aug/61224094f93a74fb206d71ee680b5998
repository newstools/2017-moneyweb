It was unclear whether she was travelling on a diplomatic passport.On whether she could be arrested while having diplomatic immunity, Mbalula said: &#8220;All those implications will be taken into consideration.&#8221; He then added: &#8220;She will be charged.&#8221;&#8220;She is not under arrest because she cooperated and handed herself over to the police. But a case has been opened,&#8221; he said.It was not clear at which court Grace would appear.Neither Grace Mugabe, Zimbabwe information minister Christopher Mushohwe nor Mugabe&#8217;s spokesman George Charamba were available to comment.A Zimbabwean intelligence source said Grace had been travelling on an ordinary non-diplomatic passport. &#8220;She was here on business,&#8221; the source told Reuters.Mugabe sonsSouth Africa&#8217;s News24 website said 20-year-old model Gabriella Engels had been visiting the Mugabes&#8217; sons Robert and Chatunga at a hotel in the upmarket Sandton district over the weekend when she was set upon by Grace.&#8220;When Grace entered, I had no idea who she was. She walked in with an extension cord and just started beating me with it,&#8221; she told the news website.&#8220;She flipped and just kept beating me with the plug. Over and over. I had no idea what was going on. I was surprised &#8230; I needed to crawl out of the room before I could run away.&#8221;News24 published a picture of what it said was Engels with a large gash in her forehead. &#8220;I am a model, with this scar over my face my whole career is ruined,&#8221; she said.It was unclear what triggered the incident.Mugabe&#8217;s two sons were kicked out of the Regent luxury apartment complex in Sandton a month ago after an incident in the middle of the night, staff at the complex told Reuters.Regent manager Imelda Fincham did not elaborate but confirmed the pair had left. &#8220;They&#8217;re no longer here,&#8221; she said.In 2009, a press photographer in Hong Kong said Grace and her bodyguard had assaulted him.
