Scandinavia s biggest bank has studied almost 11 000 publicly traded companies across the globe and the results are crystal clear: firms with a woman running the show perform far better than the market.These are solid results, Robert Naess, the manager of $42 billion in stocks at Nordea Bank AB who designed the study, said by phone Monday. You can get a better return this way, Naess said. This effect can absolutely persist. As to why female CEOs deliver better results, the study is less clear. Naess suggests that women tend to be more conservative in their predictions, leaving more room for positive surprises. Naess also says the fact that only the very best women make it to the top means they re just higher-caliber people than a lot of male CEOs.Nordea isn t just paying lip-service to the diversity argument. Naess is also ensuring the funds he oversees reflect the logic of the study. The Nordea Global Stable Equity Fund, which has returned 14% a year over the past half decade, is slightly overweight on companies run by a women, Naess said. If you analyse a company then a female top leader will be a positive factor in the total analysis, he said. 2017 Bloomberg
