Two powerful African countries hold votes today &#8212; one with a sense of foreboding, the other with a sense of hope.Kenyans go to the polls as ethnic tensions hang in the air and threaten the same explosion of violence that has marred most of the country s elections since the early 1990s. In South Africa, investors have cheered parliament s decision to give lawmakers a secret ballot in a no-confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma today, sparking optimism that his scandal-ridden administration may soon end.A peaceful election is vital for Kenya, East Africa s economic powerhouse and a regional hub for companies including Google and Coca-Cola. While the campaign has been fiercely competitive, there s little to choose from between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his main rival, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.Instead, voting is defined mainly by ethnic loyalty. Last week s murder of an election official evoked memories of the violence that left at least 1 100 people dead after a disputed vote in 2007.In South Africa, hopes of change may well be dashed &#8212; Zuma has survived many attempts to oust him. But for all the country s problems, bloodshed is unlikely. Kenyans will just be happy if things go peacefully.Global HeadlinesTrump&#8217;s next big push | Overhauling the tax code is President Donald Trump&#8217;s next major policy push, and Republicans are looking at a plan that could help bypass Democratic opposition. Lawmakers are talking with the White House about mixing temporary rate cuts with permanent code changes aimed at deterring corporations from shifting profits offshore. While the approach might insulate the bill from a Senate filibuster, critics say it won&#8217;t reach the administration&#8217;s targets for economic growth. North Korea explains why it needs nukes | North Korea is well-known for its fiery rhetoric. But yesterday the regime adopted a more measured tone to explain why it needs nuclear weapons. In a six-page statement to journalists attending a foreign ministers summit in Manila, it said that nukes are the only way of preventing a US attack and pointed out that neither Iraq nor Afghanistan had a deterrent when they were invaded by the superpower. Other countries have nothing to fear, the statement said. China&#8217;s trade reprieve | Beijing&#8217;s decision to back UN sanctions on North Korea has helped cool trade tensions with the US, at least temporarily. As Bloomberg&#8217;s Margaret Talev reports, Trump now plans to wait at least a week &#8212; and possibly longer &#8212; before moving forward with a probe of China&#8217;s possible violations of intellectual-property rights as a reward. More Venezuela sanctions | The US is planning to freeze the assets of up to 20 more people tied to President Nicolas Maduro&#8217;s government. The expanded penalties could come as soon as today, though the US is trying to enlist support from European and South American countries &#8212; including neighboring Colombia &#8212; and may delay unilateral action in favor of a coordinated announcement.Zuma on the brink again | Zuma faces the biggest challenge of his eight-year presidency some time after 3pm local time this afternoon, when the South African parliament votes on his future. The rand rose as much as 2% against the dollar on yesterday as traders bet he may soon be gone. But he still won&#8217;t be easy to dislodge &#8212; the president&#8217;s ouster needs every opposition legislator in the 400-member assembly plus 50 from the ruling African National Congress to succeed. Succession in Mexico | There&#8217;s a sense of urgency about Mexico&#8217;s ruling party. After running the country for most of the past century, the Institutional Revolutionary Party has lost two of the past three presidential elections and has never held so few of Mexico&#8217;s 32 state governorships. As the party struggles to find a candidate for next July&#8217;s election at its assembly this week, Nacha Cattan explains that the choice will rest ultimately with the man whose dismal approval ratings have dragged his party down &#8212; President Enrique Pena Nieto. Populism in Pakistan | Putting Pakistan&#8217;s tiny, rich elite on notice, opposition leader Imran Khan vowed in an interview with Bloomberg to continue his anti-corruption campaign that&#8217;s already claimed the political scalp of former premier Nawaz Sharif. The former cricket icon hopes the message carries him to victory in next year&#8217;s elections, even as he brushes aside allegations of wrongdoing of his own regarding a property purchase and illegal foreign funding.And finally&#8230; It turns out that Andrew Cuomo was right. Back in May the governor told New York&#8217;s commuters to brace for a Summer of Hell and since then delays have gotten so bad that subway ridership saw its first decrease in more than 20 years. It&#8217;s never good news for New York mayors when the state of the subway becomes a topic at Manhattan cocktail parties and on magazine covers. Especially when they&#8217;re seeking reelection. For now, Bill de Blasio is proposing a tax on the wealthy to pay for repairs. But without a short-term fix, things could even get worse this winter. 2017 Bloomberg
