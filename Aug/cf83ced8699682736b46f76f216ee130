At a recent business breakfast held by Moneyweb and Standard Bank on the state of the Western Cape water infrastructure, Carl Haycock from Talbot &amp; Talbot addressed the stigma associated with waste water and how to overcome it. &#8211; Why has there been such a slow uptake of waste water recovery solutions in South Africa? &#8211; What is the opportunity now? How much of our waste water could we be re-using now? &#8211; What is the business opportunity? &#8211; What risks need to be considered? View Carl Haycock&#8217;s full presentation here.
