JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa has appointed Vodacom Group executive Vuyani Jarana as the new chief executive officer for the state airline, the Treasury said on Thursday. &#8220;Given that Mr Jarana has turned around a loss-making subsidiary of the Vodacom Group, Vodacom Business Africa, into profitable and growth business, we believe he will be key in turning around South African Airways,&#8221; Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said in a statement.Jarana is currently chief officer for Vodacom Business at telecoms operator Vodacom Group.
