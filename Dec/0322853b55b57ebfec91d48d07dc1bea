South Africa’s ruling party chairwoman, Baleka Mbete, plans to endorse Cyril Ramaphosa for president of the African National Congress, according to two people familiar with the situation. Mbete  is also a candidate to succeed Jacob Zuma as leader of the party and is the Speaker of Parliament. The ANC is currently meeting in Johannesburg to choose new leaders. The contest to succeed Zuma is a two-horse race between Ramaphosa, the party and nation’s deputy president, and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the president’s ex-wife, favoured candidate and former chairwoman of the African Union Commission. Mbete’s campaign for the top position didn’t get the backing from any of the country’s nine provinces. © 2017 Bloomberg
