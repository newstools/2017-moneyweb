At 0620 GMT the rand traded 0.33% weaker at 13.63 per dollar compared to an overnight close of 13.59 in New York. The dollar index was near two-week highs on expectation the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday. Statistics South Africa will release October manufacturing data, while November CPI data and October retail sales are due on Wednesday. Stocks were set to open flat at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 futures index ticking up 0.06%. Bonds were flat, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 unmoved at 9.23%.
