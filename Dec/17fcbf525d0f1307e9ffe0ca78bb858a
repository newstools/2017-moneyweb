The rand firmed on Friday and was on course to end the week up more than 3% against the dollar, as data signalled the domestic economy was on the mend. At 1500 GMT, the rand traded at 13.69 per dollar, up 0.2% from its New York close on Thursday. The rand started the week on the front foot, surging 3% on Monday as South Africa escaped a potentially painful double downgrade of its credit ratings. The currency also got support from data signalling recovery in the economy. South Africa’s new vehicle sales rose 7.2% year-on-year in November, data showed on Friday, while separately the seasonally adjusted Absa Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to its highest level in six months. “Looking ahead, we do not expect to see a major improvement in business conditions in the manufacturing sector during (first-half) 2018,” said Elize Kruger at NKC African Economics. “However, there are signs of a modest domestic economic recovery, which in combination with improving global economic conditions could be somewhat of a positive offsetting factor.” On the bourse, stocks ended slightly lower with heavyweight Naspers taking the most points off the main index following losses at its Chinese moneyspinner, Tencent Holdings. Naspers, whose R1.6 trillion market capitalisation accounts for nearly 10% of the bourse’s value, dropped 4.2% to R3 531. Naspers owes much of its market value to its one-third stake in Tencent, which fell by more than 3% in Hong Kong. Overall, investors took their cue from a downbeat tone in major emerging markets after data showed manufacturing growth slowing in China. The JSE Top 40 Index lost 0.7% at 52 888 and the broader All Share Index lost 0.54% to 59 449. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark bond due in 2026 was up 0.5 basis points to 9.325%.
