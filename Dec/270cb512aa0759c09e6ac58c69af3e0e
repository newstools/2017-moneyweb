The retail price of petrol and the wholesale price of diesel in South Africa will increase from Wednesday due to a weaker rand currency and higher crude oil prices, the energy department said on Monday. The price of petrol will rise by 71 cents to R14.76 per litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while that of diesel will go up by 60 cents to R12.95.Â
