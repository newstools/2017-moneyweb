Anglo American is up 1.4% and is the second top riser on the FTSE 100 after Deutsche Bank upgraded it to “hold” from “sell” following a recent more than 10% pull back. The broker flags that multiples are undeniably cheap versus peers and shareholder activism/M&A are medium-term upside risks. Deutsche Bank notes that Anglo has shrunk in size compared to its global peers and owns several prized businesses (primarily its Chilean copper assets and De Beers). The recent stake increase by Volcan to about 21% has reignited M&A conjecture, Deutsche Bank says. Deutsche Bank says merger between Anglo and Vedanta Resources (Volcan’s main mining subsidiary) will be difficult to achieve, but a clearer political backdrop in 2018 could induce other strategic players. The bank flags the ANC National conference, scheduled for 16-20 December, which should determine the successor to South Africa President Zuma.
