South Africa’s Shoprite confirmed on Friday that Steinhoff’s African subsidiary has exercised call options to acquire a 23.1% stake and 50.6%  voting control in Africa’s largest grocer. Steinhoff Africa Retail, or STAR, said in August it would look to acquire a controlling stake in supermarket operator Shoprite in a share deal worth R35.5 billion that would give it exposure to shoppers in South Africa and 14 other African markets. Shoprite said STAR’s investment would be subject to a number of conditions including various merger filings.
