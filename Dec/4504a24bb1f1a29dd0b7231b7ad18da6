Investors cheering Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory in South Africa’s ruling-party elections may be getting ahead of themselves. The reformist agenda of Ramaphosa does have the potential to help accelerate economic recovery, avoid a credit-rating downgrade and strengthen the currency, according to money managers including Credit Agricole CIB and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Yet, markets aren’t factoring in the formidable challenges that could limit progress, they say. The rand headed for its biggest two-day gain since 2015 and the benchmark equity gauge rebounded from a three-week losing streak. That optimism could prove overdone if the traditionalist faction of the African National Congress challenges Ramaphosa’s win or President Jacob Zuma’s supporters hinder the new leader’s program. “The market is getting ahead of itself,” says Guillaume Tresca, a Paris-based strategist at Credit Agricole. “First, Zuma could remain president until 2019, which means there is a risk of negative political noise. Second, there could be a balance of power to keep the unity of ANC, so it could be less positive than earlier thought.” Other investors express similar views: © 2017 Bloomberg
