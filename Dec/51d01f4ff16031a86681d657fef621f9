        Many delegates said if NDZ won, the ANC would have lost the 2019 elections. With a Cyril win, the party has an opportunity to regain lost votes. #ANC54 — Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) December 18, 2017  On paper, the mix of the #Top6 can unify the movement & country. Now for implementation #ANCConference2017 — Tshepo Sefotlhelo (@TshepoSefo) December 18, 2017  Cyril and Gwede will constantly have to watch their backs. Sleep with one eye open chaps. This is going to be intense. Bitter sweet for Cyril. #ANC54 — Khaya Dlanga (@khayadlanga) December 18, 2017  No words necessary. pic.twitter.com/xRuSjaYNuh — Ferial Haffajee (@ferialhaffajee) December 18, 2017  ZAR realizing all is not moonlight & roses. Back above 12.70. Off a low of 12.56. — Karin Richards (@Richards_Karin) December 18, 2017  I must have been mistaken to think the ANC was a party favouring 50:50 quotas for women. It is 50:50 quotas for factions. — Helen Zille (@helenzille) December 18, 2017  Cyril, Gwede and Mashatile have a tough task ahead fighting off two thugs and a captured stoogie in that top 6. Only answer is a strong NEC — Nkareng Matshe (@Nkareng) December 18, 2017  Team Ramaphosa 3, Team Zuma 3.There will be significant tension and division in the ANC top 6. Is this a sign of unity or the first sign that the inevitable split in the ANC will be right down the middle? I think the latter. #anc54th — Ryk van Niekerk (@Ryk_van_Niekerk) December 18, 2017  Let’s assume Ramaphosa has the *best intentions*. But does he have the guts required to stand up to the rest of the Top 6 with 2 very Premier League strongmen? History says no, he stood by silently while Zuma & acolytes looted the state. So the answer is no. — Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) December 18, 2017  A Pyrrhic victory for Ramaphosa. He will be hindered and hamstrung by Zuma allies Ace and DD who have their own skeletons and clouds hanging over them. He will keep an eye over his shoulder. But he is the President of the ANC and that comes with great power as JZ has shown. — Mandy Wiener (@MandyWiener) December 18, 2017  In electing CR, ANC officially rejects corruption, incompetence and state capture. That gives me so much hope for the future! We get South Africa back today. Challenges are many but tonight is the time to open champagne! — Magda Wierzycka (@Magda_Wierzycka) December 18, 2017  Spare a thought for Cyril Ramaphosa: it's not clear whether he's won the presidency of the ANC in fact or simply been appointed head prefect of the Saxonwold Shebeen: The leadership battle is technically won but in reality the war for the bruised soul of an ailing ANC continues. — Eusebius McKaiser (@Eusebius) December 18, 2017  #ANC. CR will have difficulty pushing for JZ recall, given that three members of top six are not his supporters. — Raymond Suttner (@RaymondSuttner) December 18, 2017  The branches have spoken case closed I join thousands congratulating the New leadership #YouhaveMySupport — RSA Minister of Police (@MbalulaFikile) December 18, 2017  I don’t see hope for the poor and marginalized in this top 6. Let alone affirmative action — Sure Kamhunga (@sure_kamhunga) December 18, 2017  Ramaphosa's best bet now is to put in place a strong and independent NDPP who will prosecute state capture and corruption cases. That way he will weed out Zuma/Gupta allies in powerful positions and restore credibility. He will have to move quickly. — Mandy Wiener (@MandyWiener) December 18, 2017  Three observations: 1: Only one woman part of the top six. The ANC needs to be disappointed with that.  2: It’s also great that that none of the dominant tribes have the top spot.  3: Lack of youth.  The party is still stuck in old thinking. #ANC54 — Khaya Dlanga (@khayadlanga) December 18, 2017
