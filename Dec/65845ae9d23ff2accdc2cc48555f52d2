The rand fell more than one% against the US dollar on Thursday as the greenback rose, while stocks edged up slightly, despite another share plunge by Steinhoff International. At 1543 GMT, the rand was 1.11% weaker at 13.67 per dollar, after earlier hitting a session low of 13.69. “It’s more the dollar play than anything else,” said TreasuryOne currency dealer Phillip Pearce. The dollar hit a two-week high against a basket of currencies on Thursday on stronger risk appetite across markets and on optimism that the United States will successfully push through a tax reform programme. South African investors are also wary ahead of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) leadership conference next week, where a successor to the current leader, President Jacob Zuma, will be crowned. The rand had gained earlier this week on hopes that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa – who is seen as more investor friendly – will win the race to become the next leader of the ANC.
