Standard Bank has followed similar moves by its rivals Absa and Nedbank and will hike credit card fees and charges for in-branch transactions from January. It has introduced a monthly card fee of either R10, R25 or R40 (depending on the card) alongside the service fee for those customers who hold standalone credit cards, i.e. not bundled with a current account. This sees increases of the all-in fee on credit cards of between 11% and 40%. A customer with a Gold credit card, for example, will pay R50 (R40 service fee + R10 card fee) per month, from R45 currently. Bundled Prestige Banking (“Platinum”), Consolidator Gold and Professionals customers are unaffected as credit cards are included in the monthly fee.  Credit cards – monthly fee 2018 2017 Change Platinum standalone R80 (R40 + R40) R57/R65* 40% / 23% Titanium standalone R65 (R40 + R25) R55 18% Gold standalone R50 (R40 + R10) R45 11% Blue standalone R50 (R40 + R10) R45 11% Access standalone R50 (R40 + R10) R45 11% Initiation fee R165 R145 14% Card replacement fee R130 R130 0% * Before/after accounts opened on May 6 2016 Standard Bank is the last of the four full-service banks to split monthly credit card fees into two separate parts. FNB charges an account fee and a credit facility service fee to those clients not on bundled accounts, Absa charges a monthly account fee and credit facility service fee, while Nedbank charges a minimum monthly credit card service fee (which could be as much as R68.40) as well as a credit facility fee. In-branch transactions, particularly those involving cash, now attract more punitive fees. Cash deposits in branches will cost R8 plus R1.80 per R100 or part thereof, with a minimum charge of R40. A year ago, the fees were the same but there was no minimum. This will impact the deposit of smaller amounts significantly. For example, a cash deposit of R2 000 will cost R42 in January, while a deposit of R100 will cost R40. Nedbank has also hiked in-branch cash-handling fees. From January, in-branch cash deposits at Nedbank will cost R30 plus R1.50 for every R100 (or part thereof), from the 2017 price of R11 plus R1.40/R100. In-branch cash deposits at Absa attract a charge of R8 + 1.6% of the deposit value, with a minimum charge of R35. The pricing of Standard Bank’s bundled monthly service fees is up 5% on its low-end Access account (R5.25 from R4.99), unchanged on its mid-market Elite Banking account (R100) and 2% higher on its upper-end Prestige Banking account (R195 from R190). Minimum monthly fees on pay-as-you-transact Elite and Prestige accounts are up ±10% to R60 and R104, respectively. Aside from in-branch fees, much per-transaction pricing remains unchanged. There are increases for cash withdrawals at other banks’ ATMs, declined transactions at point of sale, and the penalty on declined debit orders because of insufficient funds has changed to R60 for the first three per year, and R145 thereafter (from a flat fee of R115 currently). For those not on bundled pricing, the charges for external debit orders and electronic account payments increase.   Elite Banking Prestige Banking 2018 2017 2018 2017 Monthly fee R100 R100 R195 R190 Electronic debits, balance enquiries, POS, cash at till Unlimited Unlimited Unlimited Unlimited Cash withdrawal – Standard Bank ATM 4 4 8 8 Cash deposit – Standard Bank ATM 3 3 3 3 Internet, app, cellphone banking Free Free Free Free Annual credit card fee N/A (separate charge) Titanium free Pay-as-you-transact pricing (and for transactions over and above those included in bundled option) Minimum monthly service fee** R60 R55 R104 R94 Monthly cheque card fee R8.75 R8.25 R12.50 R12.50 Cash withdrawal – Standard Bank ATM R1.80 per R100 R1.80 per R100 R1.80 per R100 R1.80 per R100 Cash withdrawal – POS R1.80 R1.80 R1.80 R1.80 Cash withdrawal – Other ATM R8 + R1.80 per R100 R6.70 + R1.80 per R100 R8 + R1.80 per R100 R6.70 + R1.80 per R100 Cash deposit – Standard Bank ATM R1.80 per R100 R1.80 per R100 R1.80 per R100 R1.80 per R100 Cash deposit – Branch R8 + R1.80 per R100 (R40 minimum) R8 + R1.80 per R100 R8 + R1.80 per R100 (R40 minimum) R8 + R1.80 per R100 Airtime purchase using Standard Bank channels R1.10 R1.10 R1.10 R1.10 Debit order (internal) R4.50 R4.50 R4.50 R4.50 Debit order (external) R16.50 R16 R16.50 R16 Electronic inter-account transfers (excl savings) R4 R4 R4 R4 Electronic account payment R5.50 R4 R5.50 R4 Balance enquiry at Standard Bank ATM – print R1.50 R1.50 R1.50 R1.50 Monthly fee on overdrafts over R500 R68.40 R68.40 R68.40 R68.40 Garage card purchase R5 R5 R5 R5 Declined debit order (insufficient funds) R60 for first 3 per year, R145 thereafter R115 R60 for first 3 per year, R145 thereafter R115 Declined POS (insufficient funds) R8.40 R7.90 R8.40 R7.90 Declined cash withdrawal – Standard Bank ATM R2.60 R2.60 R2.60 R2.60 Replacement card (chip/cheque card) R130 R130 R130 R130 * Includes ATM withdrawals, electronic inter-account transfers, electronic account payments, cheque card purchases and debit orders.
