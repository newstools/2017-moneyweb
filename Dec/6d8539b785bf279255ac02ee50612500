A South African government programme that produced the world’s fastest-growing renewable-energy market has screeched to a standstill, with asset financing for projects plunging to $4 million this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The decline stems from state power utility Eskom Holdings’s refusal to sign government-guaranteed purchase agreements with independent producers, leaving developers in limbo. President Jacob Zuma on Thursday failed to give an update on the projects, despite expectations raised by energy minister David Mahlobo.    © 2017 Bloomberg
