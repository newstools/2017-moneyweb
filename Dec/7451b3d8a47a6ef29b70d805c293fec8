South Africa’s rand was firmer early on Wednesday, helped by a dip in the dollar and jostling for positions ahead of economic and political events locally and offshore. At 0645 GMT the rand had gained 0.31% to 13.63 per dollar from a close of 13.67 overnight in New York. The greenback retreated from a four-week high after a surprise Democrat victory in a US Senate election in Alabama, reducing the Republican majority and making it harder for President Donald Trump to push through tax cut plans. The rand was given impetus by the dollar slide, opening the door for traders looking to cement bets of large moves in either direction ahead of local inflation data and a rates decision by the US Federal Reserve. Market attention is also zooming in on court battles between factions of the ruling African National Congress ahead of a party conference at the weekend where President Jacob Zuma’s successor is set to be chosen. Technical resistance seen around 13.64 suggests rand gains could be reversed by end of trade, with investors overall sentiment still bearish. Stocks were set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 futures index up 0.25%. Bonds were flat with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 0.5 basis points at 9.27%.
