The FTSE/JSE All Share Index closed on Friday December 8 at 58 012, 3.0% lower than where it had started the month. The 90% decline in Steinhoff International’s share price was clearly the big story, but it was far from the only stock under pressure. The negative sentiment towards the furniture retailer spread to Steinhoff Africa Retail (Star), Stellar Capital Partners and Brait. Star fell over 30.0%, while Stellar and Brait both shed more than 15.0%. KAP Industrial and Shoprite also took some pain but to a much lesser extent, losing 8.7% and 5.0% respectively. The concerns around Steinhoff’s financials weren’t however the only bad news that investors had to manage in the week. Shares in ICT firm EOH slid 43.5%, possibly due to raids by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) looking into corruption in the South African Police Service in which EOH has been implicated in the past. Naspers also edged lower as shares in Tencent came off. Concerns around MultiChoice’s potentially improper involvement in the government’s decision to use unencrypted set-top boxes for South Africa’s digital migration also weighed on sentiment. The share prices of a number of resource counters also fell on a stronger rand and indications that Zimbabwe’s new government will still require mining companies in that country to cede 51% of their shares to locals. Impala Platinum was off 17.2%, AngloGold Ashanti shed 12.9%, and Sibanye-Stillwater fell 10.5%. Overall, it was a very tough environment in which to be a fund manager. As the table below indicates, a number of local funds suffered some sharply negative returns over this seven-day period.

It was one of the funds most exposed to the stock. It’s notable that the Investec Value Fund features high up this list even though it had no exposure to Steinhoff at all. It suffered from the fall in some of its major resource holdings. Impala, AngloGold and Sibanye-Stillwater together make up more than a quarter of the fund. The Foord Equity Fund is another notable member of this list. Stenhoff was its fourth largest holding at the end of November at 6.2% of the portfolio. It’s notable that the last week’s losses more than wiped out the gains made by some of these funds this year. This is pretty tough on investors who would have just been feeling some relief that the local market was delivering some positive returns again.
