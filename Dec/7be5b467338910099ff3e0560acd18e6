Consumers are encouraged to budget and spend wisely over the festive season to avoid the consequences of defaulting on mandatory debit order payments. The number of customers who default on debit orders often spikes between December and January, due to increased spending during the festive period.  Although consumers do deserve to celebrate at the end of the year and spend quality time with friends and family, they should be careful not to spend haphazardly at the expense of important financial obligations.  Here are four risks of skipping debit order payments: Consumers should take advantage of early December debit order payment offers from various service providers which allow payments to be collected as early as December 15 to help consumers avoid defaulting.   Furthermore, take into account that there are a number of unforeseen expenses and emergencies that can set you back financially in January, such as transport costs, and back to school expenses, among other factors.  Making debit order payments a priority when planning your budget for the festive season can go a long way to ensuring that you start the New Year stress free.  Ryan Prozesky is CEO of FNB Consumer Core Banking.
