South Africa’s rand weakened on Thursday, giving back the gains that saw the currency reach its firmest in 2-1/2 years as investors took profits ahead of the final trading day of 2017. At 01:30 the rand was 0.93% softer at 12.38 per dollar, having earlier touched 12.2400, its strongest level since June 2015. Traders said the rand was now overbought and ripe for profit-taking as euphoria fades following last Monday’s leadership change in the ruling African National Congress. The rand has gained close to 10% since Cyril Ramaphosa was elected to succeed President Jacob Zuma as head of the ANC last Monday. With liquidity low over the festive period, moves in the currency are likely to be larger than usual in either direction, while the rand’s breach of key technical milestones would also attract algorithmic momentum selling, analysts at 4Cast said. Speculation that Ramaphosa, who is likely to become the country’s leader after elections in 2019, may seek to remove the scandal-tarnished president from office before then has ignited further interest in the rand in recent sessions. In another potential blow to Zuma, South Africa’s top court will rule on Friday on a bid to compel parliament to launch impeachment proceedings against the president over a scandal related to state-funded upgrades to his private home. Bonds were firmer, with the yield on benchmark paper due in 2026 down 14.5 basis points to 8.57%. Stocks firmed marginally, with the benchmark Top-40 index rising 0.16% to 52,071.17 while the broader All-share index added 0.19% to 58,952.89.
