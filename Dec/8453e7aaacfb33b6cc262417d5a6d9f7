Supporters of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is vying to become the leader of South Africa’s ruling party, plan to nominate Zweli Mkhize for chairman of the African National Congress, according to five people familiar with the matter. Mkhize, the party’s treasurer-general who was also a candidate for leader, would compete against Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe for the position, the people said, asking not to be named because the negotiations are private. It’s not clear whether Mkhize will accept the nomination. The contest to succeed President Jacob Zuma is a two-horse race between his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, and Dlamini-Zuma, the president’s ex-wife, his preferred candidate and former chairwoman of the African Union Commission. © 2017 Bloomberg
