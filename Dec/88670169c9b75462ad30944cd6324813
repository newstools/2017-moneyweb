The High Court in the South African town of Mahikeng disqualified branches representing 50 delegates from attending a ruling party electoral conference that starts Saturday in a blow to the hopes of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of succeeding her ex-husband, Jacob Zuma, as head of the party and national president in 2019. The court disqualified 32 branches from the Bojanala municipal region, according to North North West Provincial secretary Dakota Legoete. Branches in the province mostly indicated that they would be backing Dlamini-Zuma at the conference against Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. “This is judicial overreach,” Legoete said. “The courts are playing politics now. In other countries the army makes coups. Here it’s the judiciary.” The ANC will appeal the ruling, he said. The contest is likely to be tightly fought. Ramaphosa received the backing of 1 860 branches nationwide ahead of the conference Dlamini-Zuma was supported by 1 330. Still, the delegates aren’t bound to vote the way their branches have indicated and they only account for 90% of the ballot. The rest come from provincial and national party leadership as well as women’s, veterans and youth leagues. A win for Ramaphosa, a former trade unionist who built a multi-billion rand business empire before becoming the party’s deputy president, could spark a rand rally to below 13 per dollar, a level last seen in September, according to Rand Merchant Bank. Victory for his main opponent, former chairwoman of the African Union Commission, could see the currency test the record-weak levels it posted last year. © 2017 Bloomberg
