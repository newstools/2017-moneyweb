The Helen Suzman Foundation, supported by Magda Wierzycka, has initiated legal proceedings against Eskom, Jacob Zuma as president of South Africa, the Gupta family, Duduzane Zuma and others in a bid to recover R5 billion in illicit expenditure. Below follows a statement written by Wierzycka in her personal capacity, explaining the rationale behind the action. 9.1 The decisions by Eskom, its Board and its officials, to award Gupta-related entities, including Tegeta Exploration and Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Tegeta”), coal supply and emergency coal supply agreements worth billions of Rand without just and proper cause, any procurement process and with the unlawful objective of benefitting the Gupta family and its businesses;  9.2 The unlawful and corrupt conduct by Eskom’s officials, Mr Seleke, Minister Zwane and the Gupta family and associates in forcing the sale of Optimum Coal Holdings (Pty) Ltd and its subsidiaries (“Optimum”) to Tegeta;                                        9.3 The issuing of guarantees and making of prepayments worth billions of Rand unlawfully and corruptly to benefit the Gupta family and its business interests, including the financing of the purchase of Optimum by Tegeta;                                  9.4 The unlawful and corrupt conclusion of sponsorship agreements worth over R43 million between Gupta’s TNA Media (Pty) Ltd and Eskom;                                                                                                                                                                      9.5 the corrupt and unlawful gratification, including appointments, payments and other benefits given to various public officials, including Minister Zwane, Mr Collin Matjila, Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Mark Pamensky; and                                          9.6 the unlawful appointments of Mr Seleke as the Director General of the Department of Public Enterprises and Mr Zwane as the Minister of Mineral Resources. 10. We are seeking, in the public interest, the recovery of all unlawfully obtained benefits which resulted from corrupt and unlawful conduct. To the extent that the information about illicit benefits is incomplete, we ask the Court to order a full and proper accounting to be delivered by all relevant parties. 11. This application intends to hold all those responsible for corruption to account, in accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law.  Civil society has been forced to take these steps in the public interest as a result of the inability or unwillingness of law enforcement agencies to take any action.
