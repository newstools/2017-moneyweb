The current fast-paced news cycle and the buoyant mood investors are in makes it easy to forget just how much of a roller coaster of a year the rand has had. Here is a quick recap.      In mid-February, Pravin Gordhan delivered his budget speech, which calmed a few fears in the market and brought the rand to R12.89. This goodwill carried into March, bringing the rand to R12.43. However, in late March, President Jacob Zuma initiated his first of two cabinet reshuffles of the year. Out went Gordhan and in came Malusi Gigaba. Within days, the country received the news of a rating downgrade and in early April, the rand tumbled to R13.91. Throughout June and July, the biggest news stories related to the #GuptaLeaks, causing further volatility in the rand. During September South Africans were shocked to hear how Bell Pottinger was behind news stories stirring up racial tensions on behalf of the Guptas.  In October,  Zuma initiated his second cabinet reshuffle, sending the rand spiraling to R14.24. The rating agencies, acting as swiftly as they did in April, further downgraded SA’s debt, resulting in a high of R14.47 in November. As many finance professionals were finalising their December leave plans, Steinhoff announced that the CEO, Markus Jooste, was resigning with immediate effect and that the release of audited financial statements was suspended until further notice. Cue the loss of over R220 billion of investors’ money and even more negative investor sentiment. However, the recent election of Cyril Ramaphosa as the next ANC president, as well as the subsequent recovery of the rand to levels below R13 has provided a welcome warmth to investors.
