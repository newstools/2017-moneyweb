Multinational brewing and beverage company Distell has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its cognac business Bisquit Dubouche et Cie, to global beverage company Campari Group for €52.5 million (R793.35 million). “Campari Group will acquire all the shares in Bisquit, as well as existing stock, maturing inventory, the trademarks as well as production facilities consisting of warehouses, blending cellars and a bottling plant,” states Distell. The Bisquit brand’s key markets include South Africa, Belgium and Switzerland. Distell MD Richard Rushton said the Bisquit brand remained strong and well positioned for long-term growth. “Distell’s decision to sell the business is driven by our strategic intent to focus on a core portfolio of categories, brands and assets that support the company’s growth ambitions. “The sale will ensure the assets within our portfolio align with our strategy and generate long-term shareholder value. The disposal of Bisquit will allow us to focus our efforts on accelerating our growth in key product categories and markets where we believe we can deliver more attractive returns and deliver on our growth aspirations.” The deal is expected to close during the first quarter of 2018.
