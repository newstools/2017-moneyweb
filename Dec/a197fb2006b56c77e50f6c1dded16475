Ether and litecoin, the second and fourth biggest cryptocurrencies, are surging to all-time highs on optimism that bitcoin futures will attract institutions to the fledgling market. Litecoin has more than doubled to $322.80 since December 10, before the bitcoin derivatives started trading, while ether is up 43% to $630.70, according to CoinmarketCap. The gains are even beating bitcoin’s advance, as some traders move into digital assets that have lagged bitcoin’s 17-fold rally this year, hoping to get similar returns. All of the top 20 biggest cryptocurrencies are rising today.
