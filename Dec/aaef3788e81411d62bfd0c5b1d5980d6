Steinhoff International Holdings is seeing credit facilities being withdrawn or suspended by lenders as the global retailer battles to survive amid an accounting crisis. The owner of Conforama in France, Mattress Firm in the US and Poundland in the UK isn’t yet able to assess the magnitude of accounting regularities first revealed two weeks ago, the South African company said in a presentation to lenders, published on its website Tuesday. Steinhoff also can’t yet say when it will be able to publish audited results for 2017 and 2016 nor whether additional years will need to be restated.  The shares resumed a plunge that has wiped more than 80% off the value of the company since the scandal broke. They slumped by more than 20% in Frankfurt, before paring losses to trade 5.3% lower at 0.549 euros as of 2:27pm local time. Steinhoff had outstanding debt of 10.7 billion euros ($12.7 billion) as of December 14, the company said. Almost 4.8 billion euros was in Steinhoff Europe, an operation based in Austria. Steinhoff didn’t have “detailed visibility” of the cash flows of individual operation companies, it said in the same presentation. © 2017 Bloomberg
