Investec Plc, the South African bank that’s carved out a leading role financing US rooftop solar, hired a former Varagon Capital Partners banker to oversee Americas clean-tech deals, according to people familiar with the matter. Ren Plastina, a former partner at Varagon Capital Partners, began at Investec Monday and reports to Ralph Cho and Michael Pantelogianis, co-heads of power & infrastructure in the Americas, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to discuss the hire publicly. Plastina’s LinkedIn page already shows him working at Investec, in New York. A spokesman for Investec didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment Monday. Investec has become one of the biggest backers of US rooftop solar projects, a market that initially made some banks leery in part because deals are underpinned by thousands of small, consumer contracts. It arranged last year $880 million in debt financing for rooftop solar developers and financiers — more than half of the $1.5 billion bank debt raised in 2016, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Plastina will oversee deals in storage, transportation, electric-vehicle charging and grid-efficiency projects, the people said. He left Varagon earlier this year, where he focused on higher-yield debt. He previously worked at BNP Paribas SA.
