South Africa’s rand firmed nearly one-and-a-half percent on Friday on a court ruling affecting delegates set to take part at a conference of the African National Congress and investors cutting long dollar positions amid tight liquidity. At 1107 GMT the rand was 1.41% firmer at 13.30 per dollar. Analysts said the ruling could block some delegates from Kwazulu-Natal province who support Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former cabinet minister, from taking part at the conference called to elect a new leader to replace President Jacob Zuma.
