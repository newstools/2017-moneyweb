It’s taken South Africa’s rand exactly nine months — and a new ruling-party leader — to claw back the losses it suffered after President Jacob Zuma unexpectedly fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in March. The rand gained 1% on Wednesday to 12.3900 per dollar, the strongest on a closing basis since July 2015, and less than five cents from its best level on March 27. Gordhan’s dismissal sent the currency plunging 11% over two weeks and sparked a credit-rating downgrade to junk. The rand has rallied about 6% since Cyril Ramaphosa, who has pledged to revive the struggling economy and stamp out corruption, was elected as leader of the African National Congress on Dec. 18. That set the billionaire businessman on a path to take over from Zuma as the country’s president.  “The market is positively surprised by the increasing amount of support that Mr Ramaphosa is rallying behind him,” Simon Quijano-Evans, an emerging-market strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, said by email. “He is likely to continue doing so, increasing speculation about another no-confidence motion in the presidency in 2018.” Members of the ANC’s newly elected executive committee will meet with Zuma to advise him to step down in favor of Ramaphosa, Johannesburg’s City Press reported on Dec. 24, citing unidentified people. Ramaphosa beat Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who was backed by the president, to the top ANC position in a closely contested vote. Flows into South African stocks and bonds have soared since the vote. Foreigners bought a net R6.4 billion ($516 million) of debt and R13.4 billion of equities in the week ending Dec. 22, according to JSE Ltd. data. © 2017 Bloomberg
