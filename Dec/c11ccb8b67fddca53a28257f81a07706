Matshela Koko was reinstated by the board of Eskom to his role as acting CEO, on Friday morning.  Previously the head of generation at the state utility, he was suspended and subject to an internal probe relating to the company’s dealings with his step-daughters’ company, Impulse International, that was awarded at least R1 billion in contracts from Eskom. Koko was also central to approving the loan of some R650 million made by Eskom to the Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources, which enabled the purchase of the Optimum Coal mine in April of last year.  The board found him not guilty on all charges and he was reinstated by Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown at a board meeting held at the company’s headquarters in Johannesburg.  This is a developing story.
