In the topsy-turvy world of South African stocks, a triumph for investors’ preferred candidate in the contest to lead the ruling African National Congress could weaken the country’s benchmark index. The victor, likely to be either Cyril Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, would need to commit to spending discipline and the rebuilding of key state institutions like the revenue service and the prosecuting body to win over investors, according to John Orford, who helps manage about R600 billion ($37 billion) in equities at Old Mutual Investment Group. “Broadly speaking, that’s what the market would want whoever becomes president of the ANC to push for, and the market probably thinks that Ramaphosa is more likely to deliver that,” Orford said by phone from Cape Town. “We would have to look carefully at what either of them said and did following their election, but the initial reaction will be pro-rand if Ramaphosa wins and rand weaker if Dlamini-Zuma wins.”  Success for the Ramaphosa campaign in the December 16-20 elective conference in Johannesburg may prompt investors to price in a higher probability of structural reforms, boosting confidence in the economy and causing the currency to appreciate. That’s not necessarily good news for benchmark index heavyweights with significant foreign operations and those with listings in developed markets that benefit from rand weakness.       “The overall equity market might come under pressure,” Orford said. “Within that, the local interest rate-sensitive equities — banks, retailers — will do better in that environment and the rand hedges would probably underperform.” Conversely, a choice of Dlamini-Zuma to succeed her ex-husband Jacob Zuma as head of the ANC and the party’s presidential candidate in 2019 elections may rattle the currency and prompt stock investors to seek shelter in the likes of Richemont, British American Tobacco, Naspers and Anglo American.       Here are the views of some other analysts and investors on the ANC conference’s stock-market impact: © 2017 Bloomberg
