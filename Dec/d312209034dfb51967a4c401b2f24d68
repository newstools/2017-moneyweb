With the holiday period already upon us, getting to grips with managing your credit card digitally can go a long way to ensuring stress free festive season spending.  During the festive season when time is a luxury, consumers should take advantage of self-service platforms on their banks’ digital and electronic channels in order to conveniently manage their credit cards. We are seeing an increase in the number of customers who choose to maintain their credit cards through the FNB App, online banking as well as our vast network of FNB ATM, ADT or Slimlines across the country. These are the advantages of managing your credit card digitally: Digital platforms also come in handy for minor day to day card maintenance services like retrieving historical statements, transferring cash to another card or viewing the latest transactions, etc.  Take advantage of digital banking channels when managing your credit card this festive season, not only are they cost effective and convenient, they are quick, allowing you to spend valuable time with your loved ones.  Chris Labuschagne is CEO of FNB Credit Card.
