European stocks recovered strongly from multi-week lows on Monday after the US Senate passed a tax package delivering significant fiscal stimulus, which investors had anticipated would give extra legs to the bull run in equity markets. Gains in the US dollar helped Germany’s dollar-exposed DAX shoot up from a two-month low, up 1.5%. The euro’s strengthening has weighed on earnings expectations for stocks across the euro zone this quarter. The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 0.9% while euro zone blue chips jumped 1.3%, their best gains in more than two months. Bank stocks, seen as the biggest beneficiaries of tax cuts, jumped 1.2% on the day. Allianz, BNP Paribas and Santander were among the largest boosts to the index, up 1.3 to 1.9%. “It’s not extremely new news but it’s definitely helpful for equities and we assume they will be for quite some time the best-performing asset class,” said Peter Szopo, chief equity strategist at Erste Asset Management in Vienna. The top-gaining European sector was construction and materials, up 1.6% after data showed that housebuilding spurred a recovery in Britain’s construction industry last month. The biggest risers in the sector were Swedish builder Skanska, up 3.5%, Irish building-materials group CRH, up 2.8%, and manufacturing group Melrose Industries, up 2.4%. Britain’s own blue-chip FTSE 100, however, lagged continental peers, rising 0.5% off a 10-week low as sterling slipped after a hoped-for Brexit divorce deal failed to materialise. Dialog Semiconductor tumbled 24% to a 17-month trough after the iPhone supplier said top customer Apple could be working on building its own power-management chips, though it said it saw no impact on its business next year. Shares in furniture retailer Steinhoff dropped 9.8% after it said it would release unaudited results for its full fiscal year due to an ongoing criminal and tax investigation in Germany.
