The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) on Friday handed down its decision regarding Eskom’s tariff increase for the 2018/19 financial year, which will have massive implications for the state utility and government’s finances as a whole. Read: Regulator slashes Eskom’s revenue Eskom had sought a revenue increase of 19.9% which would have allowed total allowable revenue for the year to come to R219.5 billion. Instead, Nersa opted to grant an increase of just 5.23%, limiting total allowable revenue to just R190.34 billion and in so doing, erased approximately R29 billion in potential income from Eskom’s books. No wonder the utility was “disappointed”. “Eskom notes and is disappointed with today’s decision by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) on Eskom’s allowed revenue of R190.348 billion for the 2018/19 financial year,” per its response. The significance of this cannot be understated. Eskom’s financial position is extremely precarious. To fund the development of its new fleet of power stations, the utility has been taking on ever more amounts of debt to do so (see graph below). The servicing of its debt has been made possible through large above-inflation increases in its tariff as regulated and allowed by Nersa, which has ultimately inflicted damage on a slowing and vulnerable economy. (Electricity price increases have created a shock in the domestic economy, curtailing growth and stalling Eskom’s electricity sales.)  At the same time, and due to declining perceptions of governance, the company has almost completely shut itself out from accessing new sources of capital. Eskom was expecting to raise R39 billion this financial year from a combination of local and international bond offerings, and new relationships cultivated with export credit agencies and development finance institutions. None of these plans have to date been successful. This essentially means that Nersa has now closed the last tap Eskom can use to keep itself afloat without having to become more introspect. It will now be forced to drastically restructure its business, or, it will have to return to its shareholder –  government – for more money. If it elects to ignore the glaring inefficiencies in its business and return to government for more money, it will have to stand in line behind SAA, the SABC, and Denel, of course, as well as National Treasury itself which is looking for an additional R50 billion to plug a hole in the current budget, while the country’s investment grade credit rating hangs by a thread. Eskom, being big and important, may push its way to the front of the queue, but how much political appetite will there be to bail out the capital of corruption? Listen: Chris Yelland, editor of EE Publishers – ‘Eskom will need a massive equity injection’ So now might well be the time for Eskom to take a long hard look at itself in the mirror. It is fat, slow and ugly. It’s lived off the fruits of patronage for far too long. This is evident from the increase in its operational costs over the last five years (in the table below, included based on the way it presents its accounts). While electricity sales declined by 5% over the period, operating costs shot up: Eskom operational expenditure (R’m) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Compound annual inflation rate (2012-2017) Primary energy       46,314       60,748         69,812         83,425      84,728      82,760 12% Employee benefit       20,169       23,599         25,622         25,912      29,257      33,178 10% Net impairment loss             640         1,011           1,577           3,766         1,170        1,669 21% Other expenses       15,253       23,123         19,177         15,771      18,663      23,570 9% Total 82,376 108,481 116,188 128,874 133,818 141,177 11% Source: Eskom, Moneyweb Employee benefits – which comprise salaries, bonuses and housing benefits – have increased on average by 10% per annum over the last five years. Primary energy costs have risen even faster, by 12% on average per annum. To its credit, while these cost increases have moderated over the last two years, there was only one year Eskom contained costs below 5.2%, and that was financial year 2016. So if it cannot meet the discipline imposed by Nersa, its going to become even more indebted. It must take the knife to itself and address its cost base immediately, and modernise by restructuring over the long term if it is to avoid detonating a financial crisis in South Africa. So this is its Rubicon moment. What will it do?
