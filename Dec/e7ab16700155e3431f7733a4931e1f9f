South Africa’s inflation rate fell for a second straight month in November as food prices climbed at the slowest pace in two years. Inflation slowed to 4.6% from 4.8% in October, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said Wednesday in a report on its website. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for 4.7%. Prices rose 0.1% in the month. Price growth has now been within the Reserve Bank’s target range of 3% to 6% for eight months, the longest run since 2015. The Monetary Policy Committee reduced its benchmark rate for first time in five years in July after the economy fell into a recession early this year. While the central bank forecasts inflation will remain within the target band until at least the end of 2019, it held the key rate unchanged at 6.75% last month and forecast more increases over the next two years as uncertainty about the nation’s credit rating and the outcome of the ruling party’s leadership race raised risks for the rand and prices.  Food prices climbed 5.2% from a year earlier, the agency said. That’s the slowest pace since November 2015 and compares with 5.3% in October. The rand strengthened 0.3% to 13.63 per dollar by 10:04am in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Yields on rand-denominated government bonds due December 2026 were unchanged at 9.27%. Core inflation, which excludes the prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, energy and gasoline, slowed to 4.4% in November, from 4.5%. That’s the slowest rate since May 2012. © 2017 Bloomberg
