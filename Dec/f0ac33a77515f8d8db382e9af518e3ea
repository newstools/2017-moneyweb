If you’re like most South Africans, December is a time to enjoy some well deserved rest and relaxation. But just because you are putting your feet up, that doesn’t mean that you should let your guard down. So, if your holiday plans include spending time away from home, here’s a checklist of ten of the most important things you should be doing before setting off on that annual holiday: 1.     Make sure that your geyser is turned off at the main switch. 2.     Unplug all electrical appliances from their power supplies. This includes TVs, computers, gaming consoles, and other electronic devices. Don’t just leave them in standby mode, shut them down, switch them off, and unplug them from the wall. 3.     Check that all taps are securely closed – including those connected to the washing machine and dishwasher. 4.     If you have a gas stove or braai, make sure that the gas supply is turned off. 5.     Do a test of your house alarm system. You should also notify your alarm company when you will be leaving and returning. 6.     Pack away all outside furniture and ensure that all garden tools, bicycles, and other items are locked away. 7.     Do a check of all your security gates, burglar proofing and electric fences. 8.     If you have a safe, lock all valuables in it. 9.     Right before you leave, check that all windows and doors are securely closed and locked.  Don’t leave keys in the doors. Preferably lock all those keys in the safe with your valuables, and only take your front door key with you. 10.  Try to empty your fridge and freezer of as many perishables as you can before you go on holiday. According to Nedbank Insurance, the majority of claims they receive after the holiday period are a result of people not implementing these 10 guidelines; so following them carefully is one of the best ways of ensuring that a household disaster while you’re away doesn’t make your holiday season feel a lot less festive.
