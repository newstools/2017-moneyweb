The election of Cyril Ramaphosa as president of the ANC has already made South Africans substantially richer than they were just one month ago. The incredible gains made by the rand against the dollar have been worth over $800 to every South African in terms of the country’s per capita GDP.

Source: IMF, Renaissance Capital Global chief economist at Renaissance Capital in the UK, Charlie Robertson, however notes that it’s hard to see the rand moving stronger than R12.50 to the dollar without further political change. “South Africa, for the first time in a decade, has again become a potential reform story,” Robertson noted. “In the 1990s South Africa was a political reform story. In the 2000s it was a social reform story, with black economic empowerment. But in the 2010s, there has been no reform.” Ramaphosa’s victory, however, has given international investors hope that South Africa may be positioned for change again, similar to what has happened in Brazil. “Few think it will be as dramatic a reform story as Argentina and Egypt, but international investors believe Ramaphosa can stop the decay that has seen South Africa fall in corruption indices and ease of doing business indices,” said Robertson. “At the least, with an improvement in the investment climate, this can lift South Africa’s GDP growth by 1% to 1.5%. “That does not, however, turn South Africa into a 5% to 7% growth story that would let it escape the middle income trap,” he cautioned. “That requires a significant long-term improvement in the education sector, labour market reform which would encourage companies to hire more workers, and further efforts to attract foreign direct investors.”
