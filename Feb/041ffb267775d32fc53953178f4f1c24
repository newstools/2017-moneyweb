South African lawmakers of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party brawled with parliamentary orderlies as they were ejected from the chamber for interrupting President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s State of the Nation speech on Thursday.Scuffling spilled over into the precincts of the building, Reuters reporters saw, as the lawmakers, clad in their trademark red overalls, continued to push the orderlies ejecting them on the Speaker&#8217;s orders.Police fired stun grenades outside to disperse supporters of rival EFF and the ruling African National Congress party.The main opposition party walked out of parliament, led by official opposition leader Mmusi Maimane.Broken windows left in wake of fight between EFF MPs and parly security #SONA2017 @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/LkmRXEsCzP&mdash; Chantall Presence (@ChazPrez) February 9, 2017Teargas was released in the area where the spouses of members of the DA sat, incl Mayors of Tshwane, NMB &amp; CT. #SONA2017&mdash; Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) February 9, 2017#Sona2017 Such a shame the people leading South Africa can only offer &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; &amp; &quot;FUCK OFF!&quot; to their political opponents. *slow-clap*&mdash; Nickolaus Bauer (@NickolausBauer) February 9, 20173rd wave of riot police reinforcements emerges from basement &amp; heads towards Poorthuis exit #SONA2017 pic.twitter.com/axJncDjqAE&mdash; Thulasizwe Simelane (@ThulasSims) February 9, 2017Police vans seen rushing past the Grand Parade, presumably going after those that left moments ago #PeoplesAssembly #SONA2017 #eNCA&mdash; Pheladi Sethusa (@pheladi_s) February 9, 2017#sona2017 Everyone in the pubic galery looks depressed as Zuma starts speaking.
