JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Political tensions and weak economic growth in South Africa are the biggest challenge to its sovereign credit rating, Moody&#8217;s said on Wednesday.&#8220;Political tensions impeded key structural reforms such as comprehensive reforms of state-owned enterprises which are yet to take place and hampered growth, another key credit challenge,&#8221; said Moody&#8217;s, which rates South Africa two notches above junk status with a negative outlook.S&amp;P also said last week that infighting in the ruling African National Congress could derail government efforts to improve policy implementation and that Pretoria had little room to increase spending.
