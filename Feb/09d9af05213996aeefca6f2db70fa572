Former construction giant Murray &amp; Roberts (M&amp;R) has announced the transfer of its JSE listing from the Construction &amp; Materials sector, sub-sector Heavy Construction to the General Industries sector: Diversified Industrial.Company spokesperson Ed Jardim told Moneyweb M&amp;R applied for the transfer immediately after announcing the disposal of its South African infrastructure and building business last year. The transaction should be completed in the second half of the current financial year, he said.Jardim said the transfer is really aimed at changing perceptions about the nature of M&amp;R s business, which no longer focuses on construction, but rather on the oil and gas, power and water and mining industries. The Diversified Industrial sub-sector most closely describes the nature of the company s current businesses, Jardim said. The change in sector will be effective from Monday March 20 2017.Asked whether the recent strong movement in M&amp;R shares as Coronation sold it holdings could be related to the transfer, Jardim was doubtful. He said it is something that has been in the making for some time and only came to fruition now when the necessary approvals were obtained.
