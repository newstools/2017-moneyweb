The chief executive officer of Anglo American Platinum, the world s biggest producer of the metal, was injured by a buffalo while on holiday in December.Chris Griffith had an encounter with a buffalo and sustained injuries, the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-mailed response to questions Wednesday, without saying where the attack happened. He is back in the office; we are all wishing him a speedy recovery. He was seen in a wheelchair this week at the Mining Indaba, an industry conference in Cape Town.Griffith manages a R94 billion ($7 billion) company that has been selling and winding down its older, less-profitable operations to cut costs and adjust to a platinum price that has fallen 40% in the past five years. Sibanye Gold bought three of the Anglo American Plc unit s operations in South Africa last year.In 2012, Anglo s then CEO, Cynthia Carroll, underwent an operation following a hip injury she suffered during a horse-riding accident. Cape Buffaloes, the variety found in Africa, are considered to be among the most dangerous of wild animals. 2017 Bloomberg
