The Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (Asisa) released collective investment scheme statistics to the end of 2016 on Wednesday, revealing that there were 1 520 portfolios registered at December 31. This is an increase of 193 from the year before.Over the last ten years, the number of funds in the country has more than doubled. South Africa had only 750 collective investment schemes at the end of 2006. The greatest growth last year was in local multi-asset funds, where the number of portfolios went up from 645 to 736. The number of South African equity funds, by comparison, grew from 272 to 305.Going back to 2006, the growth in the number of multi-asset funds relative to other categories is remarkable. As the table below shows there has been only a marginal increase in fixed income funds, while the number of multi-asset portfolios has more than tripled.

From R546.7 billion in 2006, the industry was managing R2.0 trillion at the end of last year.It is significant to note how the allocation of these assets has changed in this time. Ten years ago, most of the assets in the industry were held in fixed-interest funds. There was also more money invested in equity funds than in multi-asset funds.By the end of last year, however, this had changed dramatically. As the table below shows, multi-asset funds now hold by far the most money nearly three times as much as local equity funds.

Globally, investors predominantly use equity funds, with multi-asset funds being something of a niche choice.The table below illustrates the difference between global allocations and those in South Africa.
