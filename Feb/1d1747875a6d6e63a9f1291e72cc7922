JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed slightly early on Friday but looked vulnerable to a dollar recovery, while stocks look set to open slightly lower.At 0645 GMT, the rand traded at 12.9850 per dollar, 0.27% firmer from its New York close on Thursday.The rand has broken through a number of key technical resistance points to reach its firmest levels since August 2015, as signs of economic recovery boosted demand for the unit.&#8220;The rand has lost its momentum and looks unlikely to get going again given the lack of event risk as well as the consolidation tone in global markets. This implies sideways moves on USD/ZAR and all the crosses,&#8221; Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns wrote in a note. &#8220;12.90/91 is now the key level to break if the rand rally is to resume.&#8221;Stocks were set to open lower at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index down 0.21%.In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 1 basis point to 8.63%.
