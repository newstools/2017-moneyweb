Following an investigation that started in April 2015, the Competition Commission is alleging that 17 international banks are guilty of price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand.Investec, Standard Bank of SA and Absa Bank are among those involved. The CompCom alleges that the practice has been ongoing since 2007 and has referred the matter to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution.The commission is seeking an order that the banks have contravened the Competition Act and want an administrative penalty of 10% of their annual turnover imposed on the banks.The banks accused of collusion are:Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, Investec Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc., HSBC Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse Group; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Commerzbank AG; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Nomura International Plc., Macquarie Bank Limited, Absa Bank Limited (Absa), Barclays Capital Inc, Barclays Bank plc.The commission said in a statement that it found that from at least 2007, the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/rand currency pair. Further, the commission found that the respondents manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times. Traders of the respondents primarily used trading platforms such as the Reuters currency trading platform to carry out their collusive activities. They also used Bloomberg instant messaging system (chatroom), telephone conversation and had meetings to coordinate their bilateral and multilateral collusive trading activities. They assisted each other to reach the desired prices by coordinating trading times. They reached agreements to refrain from trading, taking turns in transacting and by either pulling or holding trading activities on the Reuters currency trading platform. They also created fictitious bids and offers, distorting demand and supply in order to achieve their profit motives. The referral of this matter to the Tribunal marks a key milestone in this case as it now affords the banks an opportunity to answer for themselves, said commissioner, Tembinkosi Bonakele.More to follow.For background on currency trading, click here.
