After Massmart highlighted in August 2016 that a basket of 23 basic items increased by 12.95% over six months (between February 2016 and July 2016), Moneyweb questioned whether food price inflation was really running at 25%.It is a great pity that Massmart didn t publish an update to the price of this basket, but one would imagine that politics about perception of their &#8220;brand&#8221; when linked to this &#8220;negative&#8221; news might ve won out.A lot has happened since August. For one, the rand has continued to strengthen, from around the R14.50:$1 level to under R13, a 10% improvement. This, however, tends to take a while to filter through into the prices of goods in stores. The impact of the drought was evidenced in some rather large price movements across 2016.While there s been recovery in certain categories (such as vegetables and some fruit) others, like breads, cereals, oils and fats, have worsened. After peaking at 7% in February, inflation (as per CPI) again came close to the 7% mark towards the end of the year and was at 6.8% in December. It s moderated to 6.6% in January. (On a technical level, StatsSA updated its basket and weightings for CPI with effect from January 2017. These are done regularly and helps the underlying statistics better reflect reality as consumption patterns &#8211; and technology &#8211; change.) In the food category, however, inflation continues to run at close to double the headline CPI number:&nbsp;Jan 2016Jan 2017% change year-on-yearStatsSA CPI food90.3101.712.6%StatsSA CPI food (primary urban)91.0101.711.8%StatsSA CPI food (rural)88.4101.614.9%Retailers are obviously feeling the pinch with sales growth, in most cases, being primarily driven by this above-average inflation. In its results announcement last week, Shoprite Holdings reports internal inflation of 7.4% in the year to December 2016, more than double the rate in 2015 (2.7%). It cites internal inflation of 9.1% in the month of December, a seven-year high. Woolworths, in its interim results to December 2016, reported price inflation of 9.2% . These are very high numbers.Read Whitey Basson s last gift to ShopriteWhat s important to bear in mind as a shopper is that the kinds of price increases one experiences, especially in an above-average inflation environment, are lumpy. Prices do not move up in a straight line at 7%, or even 12%. In some cases, manufacturers and food producers will hold back increases to help boost sales. Then, after holding this price at an artificially &#8220;low&#8221; level, they may pass a substantial price increase (say, 20%). In the case of fresh produce like fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy, the prices are a lot more dynamic.Moneyweb has updated the prices of its basket of 26 goods published in August. It is important to note that this is not intended to be a completely representative basket, but the products selected cover all major categories. Promotional items have been deliberately chosen as these tend to be the cheapest on the shelf at a given point in time. Historical data was available via the retailer s deal sheets, however, updates to this require that the same items are on promotion across the most recent month.This is not the case in three instances: Albany brown bread, prawn meat (800g), and Kelloggs Corn Flakes (750g). In the case of bread, the shelf price was used. Kelloggs has had its 1kg box on promotion for a large part of this month and that price has been used (the 750g box is actually more expensive than this promotional item). For prawn meat, the smaller pack size (on promotion in Feburary) has been used but price movement in this example is not applicable (the 800g pack size s shelf price is in excess of R200). Inflation on this product may be running at 70%, but it is very likely that promotional discounting is large (linked to sales volume) and distorts this calculation. These three items have been marked with an asterisk (*). It is intended that the basket will be updated in future to fix these kinds of distortions.&nbsp;Feb 2016Aug 2016Feb 2017% change year-on-year% change since AugAce maize meal 10kgR64.99R79.99R79.9923.1% Ultra Mel custard 1LR18.99R22.99R21.9915.8%-4.3%Cadbury chocolate slab 80gR9.99R11.99R10.9910%-8.3%Selati sugar 2.5kgR27.99R32.99R32.9917.9% Clover long life milk (6 x 1l)R59.99R69.99R69.9916.7% Prawn meat (60/80 count) 800gR129.99R149.99R99.99 (400g)*N/A*N/A*Lancewood gouda/cheddar 900gR69.99R79.99R79.9914.3% Clover Krush juice 2LR21.99R24.99R23.999.1%-4%Jacobs Kr nung coffee 200gR79.99R89.99R79.99 -11.1%All Gold tomato sauce 700mlR16.99R18.99R19.9917.7%5.3%Albany brown bread 700gR9.69R10.79R12.29*26.8%*13.9%*Mrs Ball s chutney 470gR17.99R19.99R19.9911.1% Spekko rice 2kgR17.99R19.99R19.9911.1% Rump steak (per kg)R100.00R110.00R120.0020%9.1%Fattis and Monis pasta 500gR8.99R9.89R9.9911.1%1%Yum Yum Peanut Butter 800gR35.99R38.99R43.9922.2%12.8%Eggs (30, large)R36.99R39.99R39.998.1% Fanta, Sprite, Stoney 2LR12.99R13.79R12.99 6%Stork Country Spread margarine 1kgR26.99R27.99R29.9911.1%7.1%Farmer s Choice IQF Chicken 2kgR37.99R38.99R49.7931.1%27.7%Boerewors per kgR58.99R59.99R65.0010.2%8.35%Kelloggs Corn Flakes 750gR29.99R29.99R38.99 (1kg)*30%*30%*Canola oil 2LR39.99R39.99R49.9925%25%Lucky Star pilchards 400gR14.99R14.99R16.9913.3%13.3%Weet-Bix 900gR34.99R34.99R38.9911.4%11.4%Harvestime frozen mixed veg (1kg)R18.99R17.99R18.99 -5.6%A note on methodology: These comparisons are between the exact same product on promotion at the exact same supermarket group, approximately six months apart (six week ranges around both February and July 2016). Meat products aren t branded, but the exact same variant (e.g. type of boerewors) was used. The supermarket chosen is one of South Africa s largest (i.e. it has sufficient market share to be representative of the market). Deal sheets were not provided by the group (neither was any price data). In many cases, there has not been price movement between August 2016 and February 2017. This means that those price increases, in many cases very substantial ones, were passed in the first half of last year. Based on this basket, the prices of Jacobs Kr nung coffee, Harvestime frozen mixed vegetables and 1L soft drinks, on promotion, are the same as a year ago. Of course, one can probably not survive on coffee, vegetables and soft drinks only!The single biggest price increase on this list is the price of IQF (frozen) chicken. This has spiked nearly 30% since August due to government s new brining regulations, which came into force in October. The products are no longer strictly comparable as there is less brine (water) and more chicken in a 2kg pack (Retailers and manufacturers are advertising these along with straplines such as &#8220;now with more chicken&#8221;). But, a typical shopper is going to compare the current price of a 2kg pack with what it cost before regulations capped brining at 15%. This is the reality, and a 30% price increase in this category hits lower-income South Africans hardest.The promotional price of filleted chicken breasts (non-free range), which most readers of this site will be more familiar with, is up somewhere between 10% and 20% over the past year (depending on exactly when you start and end the measurement). Meat, generally, has seen price increases of close to 20% over the past year (despite what the official StatsSA basket, below, shows).Retailers and producers are increasingly reliant on volume to generate sales growth and to keep prices, especially promotional ones, as low as possible. So, it s now incredibly common to find promotions where the price per unit is kept the same as previous months, but you have to buy three (or four/five/six) of that item to get the saving (on a per item basis, prices have shot up).

Depending on what proportion of your expenses you spend on food, this number could be far worse. The typical reader here likely has very little idea of what food items actually cost (and, if they do the shopping at all, will generally frequent a Woolies).
