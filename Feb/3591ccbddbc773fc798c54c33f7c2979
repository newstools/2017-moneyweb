In communication issued on Friday by the Road Accident Fund (RAF), CEO Eugene Watson stated that the fund&#8217;s payments have come to a grinding halt.&#8220;This comes as a result of a few legal firms whose actions have disrupted an established cash management plan, which now inconsiderately prioritises them [the firms] over those who have been patiently awaiting payment.&#8221;Watson explained that for almost three years, the RAF has contended with &#8220;serious cash constraints&#8221;. This means that the fund is unable to pay all amounts due at any point in time.To combat this shortfall, the fund utilised the monthly fuel levy (of approximately R3 billion) to make more than 30 000 payments each month. A balance of payments worth R8.2bn, owed to 5 200 creditors, remains in the queue for payment.The cash management plan, which was put in place two years back, &#8220;endeavours to maintain regular payments to creditors,&#8221; Watson said. But the latest development, Watson explained, has adversely impacted the institution, disrupting its efforts to honour obligations.Despite the lack of sufficient funding, Watson said that the fund has to ensure that it continues to fulfil its mandate to compensate and rehabilitate car crash victims.&#8220;We apologise for any inconvenience caused and every effort is being made to resolve the matter speedily [so that] the RAF can resume payments.&#8221;He added: &#8220;The immediate payment halt, continued cash constraints and the unfounded liability the Minister of Finance raised in the Medium-Term Budget Speech is [further] evidence that the RAF dispensation is ineffective, unaffordable and unsustainable.&#8221;
