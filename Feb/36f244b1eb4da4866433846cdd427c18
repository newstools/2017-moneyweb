Life Healthcare claims that it will not hold Bonitas Medical Fund members liable for certain co-payments related to admissions at a number of hospitals within its network. The hospital group s decision comes days after the medical scheme notified members on its BonComprehensive, BonClassic, BonComplete, BonSave, Standard, Primary, Hospital Plus, Hospital Standard and BonEssential healthcare plans that a 30% co-payment would apply to admissions and procedures carried out at 14 hospitals nationwide.The private hospitals namely Bedford Gardens Private Hospital, Brenthurst Clinic, Carstenhof Clinic, Eugene Marais Hospital, Faerie Glen Hospital, Flora Clinic, Genesis Clinic (Saxonwold), Hilton Life Private Hospital, Kingsbury Hospital, Little Company of Mary Hospital, Rosepark Hospital, Vincent Pallotti Hospital, Wilgeheuwel Private Hospital and Wilgers Hospital all form part of the Life Healthcare Group. According to Bonitas, hospital admission costs of around R6 billion per year account for half of the scheme s total claims expenditure.In an e-mailed notice to members dated February 4, the medical aid said negotiations with hospital groups were key to managing future claims costs without affecting the level of benefits enjoyed by its members. The negotiation process includes agreeing on the tariffs charged for all hospital services used by our members, as well as assessing the quality of service. We used our increased size to our advantage and were able to negotiate more favourable hospital tariffs for the 2017 benefit year and beyond, it said.Bonitas told Moneyweb that the rates negotiated in 2016 with South Africa s three largest hospital groups should result in savings of R100 million in 2017, which will impact future contribution increases. It has already increased member contributions by an average of 11.9% for the 2017 benefit year, after registering far more medical claims in 2015 and 2016 than in previous years.The medical scheme was unable to strike a favourable deal across all of Life Healthcare s facilities during the negotiations. The tariff increases offered by each hospital group were considered along with its current level of cost efficiency. It was evident from the results that Life Healthcare s offer was the least favourable, and therefore, the scheme resolved to exclude 14 Life hospitals from being designated service providers, explained Kenneth Marion, acting chief operating officer for Bonitas Medical Fund.As a result, it said members would have to pay a 30% co-payment if voluntarily admitted to the hospitals in question for treatment related to non-life threatening medical conditions. Marion said the medical scheme rules cater for a 30% co-payment for the use of a non-designated service provider, adding that the figure is approved and registered by The Council for Medical Schemes. These hospitals are situated in major metropolitan areas, where there are a number of similar alternative facilities available within a short distance where no co-payment will be incurred. As a result, we do not expect that the change will significantly impact the level, quality or accessibility of care that members have enjoyed in the past, Bonitas wrote in an e-mail to its members.In response to Moneyweb s questions, Life Healthcare said it would write-off the co-payment costs incurred by Bonitas members at the hospitals in question. Life Healthcare is obviously concerned about the impact of the 30% co-payment on patients and specialists at the 14 Life Healthcare hospitals where the co-payment comes into effect. Given these concerns, Life Healthcare has taken the decision not to enforce the 30% co-payment for patients who are admitted into these specific 14 hospitals (for certain admissions) and there will therefore be no financial impact on Bonitas members who utilise these 14 hospitals, said Matthew Prior, a funder relations and health policy executive at Life Healthcare in South Africa.The group said certain admissions refers to the fact that the scheme may not impose co-payments for prescribed minimum benefit cases. According to Prior, the group s concession would ensure that its patients have uninterrupted care and access to the Life Healthcare hospitals and doctors of their choice without the financial burden of a co-payment. He confirmed that tariffs were negotiated at a national level at the group s head office, without saying what led to Bonitas excluding and announcing a 30% co-payment at 14 of Life Healthcare s 64 facilities.&nbsp;
