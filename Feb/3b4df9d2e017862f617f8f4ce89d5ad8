JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Shares in South Africa&#8217;s banking index extended losses on Monday as investors continued to digest the competition watchdog&#8217;s recommendation that banks should be fined for rigging the rand currency.South Africa&#8217;s Competition Commission said last week it had found that more than a dozen local and foreign banks including Barclays Africa (Absa) and Standard Bank colluded to coordinate trading in the South African and US currencies.The Johannesburg Stock Exchange&#8217;s banking index extended losses to 1.54% to 7 473 points by 1200 GMT, its lowest level since February 10, before the forex rigging announcement.&#8220;There is more and more concern about what has happened with these banks colluding on this rand trading that took place,&#8221; said Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies. &#8220;It might be investors deciding to sell their shares in case there are very big fines from the authorities.&#8221;In the case of the alleged rigging of the rand, the antitrust watchdog said it had recommended fines amounting to 10% of the banks&#8217; South African annual revenues to the country&#8217;s Competition Tribunal, which adjudicates on the commission&#8217;s findings.Details of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s budget speech on Wednesday will also be the next likely trigger for price moves, trader at Global Trader Paul Chakaduka said.&#8220;Leading up to the budget we should see pressure on the financials without a doubt,&#8221; Chakaduka said.&nbsp;
