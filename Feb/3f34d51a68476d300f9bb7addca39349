US stock investors may look to a host of results from consumer-facing companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc next week for signs on whether the recent market rally has more room to run.The consumer names are among the last major companies of the S&amp;P 500 earnings season to report, but the results will also be watched for a read on spending as well as for commentary from executives on President Donald Trump&#8217;s proposal to tax imports.Retail executives, some of whom met with Trump this week , have argued such a tax will raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses.Besides Wal-Mart, Macy&#8217;s and Home Depot Inc are among the heavyweights due to report nextweek .Investors also will keep a close eye on housing-related data to gauge if a recent rise in consumer spending and inflation data is translating into higher home prices and a pick-up in home sales, market strategists said.Wall Street ended the week on a high note, with all three major indexes registering record highs and the Dow reaching a seventh straight record close.Investors were watching consumer names this week as Trump met with chief executives of Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc and six other major retailers.Next week , investors may be looking for more clues about the impact of Trump&#8217;s proposals on retailers, with particular focus on Wal-Mart, JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago said.&#8220;Maybe not so much what their earnings say as much as what their conference call will say about some of the president&#8217;s proposals around border taxes and immigration,&#8221; he said.Results from some of the largest consumer-facing companies will also provide a read on whether improving consumer sentiment is reflected in actual results, said Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors.&#8220;Does sentiment continue to work higher and eventually pull up actual results or can sentiment only take you so far until you have some follow-through in the real data? Those are the things that will be on our minds,&#8221; he said.Results from small-cap retail companies will also be pored over as these companies have struggled from a profitability standpoint, said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies.&#8220;Though retail sales numbers have been good, profitability for a lot of the retailers has not been good,&#8221; he said.&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be a big telltale sign for us. We&#8217;re overweight discretionary, thinking that was the cheapest group out there, and it still is the cheapest but&#8230; if the E drops out the PE, you run into a problem there,&#8221; he said, referring to price-to-earnings for the group.
