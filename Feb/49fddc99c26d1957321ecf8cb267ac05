My brother gave me a book for Christmas titled Tools of Titans (Tim Ferriss). Below you will find a few notes that I made along the way &#8211; mostly quotes and one or two longer paragraphs. I think it s a veritable goldmine of wisdom and advice and I hope you will find it as enjoyable, useful, and challenging as I have.The book obviously contains much more than what appears here and I highly recommend it.Note: I have bolded and italicised the ones I think are more directly relevant to investments.All the best for 2017 and beyond.&#8220;I can think&#8221; (for better decision making and better questions)&#8220;I can wait&#8221; (Plan for the day after tomorrow &#8211; big dreams take time)&#8220;I can fast (I don t have to eat, not in the short-term anyway)&#8221; (I can choose how to respond to suffering)Words of WisdomArticles to read on &#8220;Brain Pickings blog&#8221; Every morning a new arrival.
