The share price of airline company Comair closed almost 16% higher on Wednesday after an announcement that the South Gauteng High Court awarded it damages that together with interest and costs will amount to R1.16 billion.This follows an increase in the share price of more than 4% the previous day on the back of much improved interim results that saw the company more than double its profit compared to the correpsonding period.South African Airways (SAA) was ordered to pay the moneys to Comair following litigation Comair instituted against SAA fourteen years ago relating to anti-competitive travel agent incentive schemes.Comair said in a statement issued on SENS saying that the company was awarded R554 million plus interest at 15.5% thereon, which will be capped at the value of the award, plus costs, amounting to approximately R1.16 billion in total.Comair said as this has been a long and complex matter the company will need time to study the judgement.It advised shareholders that the judgement is subject to appeal by both parties and shareholders should be conscious of it when trading in the company s securities.The judgement follows after SAA was ordered in August last year to pay liquidated airline Nationwide, R104 million damages relating to the same conduct that constituted abuse of dominance.Both cases dealt only with the amount of damages, since the Competition Tribunal had already ruled on the merits earlier.SAA said in a statement it notes the ruling and will have its counsel study the contents and advise it on the way forward. It is important to note that this is one of the legacy matters, dating back to the period between 1999 and 2005 and implemented by the then management team. All of those managers left the company a while back and new business management processes were since introduced to ensure compliance with all relevant prescripts, SAA said. The current management is focused on turning the business around to ensure that SAA is commercially viable, operationally competitive and financially self-reliant in the shortest time possible. A number of interventions will be implemented and others have already been initiated aimed at ensuring positive business improvements take place in a matter of months. SAA reported a net loss of almost R1.5 billion for the 2015/16 financial year.&nbsp;
