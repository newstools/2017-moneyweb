A Moneyweb analysis of the 100 largest JSE-listed companies reveals 14 companies where more than 25% of shareholders who voted at their annual general meetings (AGMs), were not in favour of the companies remuneration policies. Despite being phrased as a vote on a broad policy, this is generally a vote on incentives and remuneration of executives and management.While there is no legal requirement to allow shareholders to vote on the matter, the King III Report on Corporate Governance, in Principle 2.27, states that Every year, the company s remuneration policy should be tabled to shareholders for a non-binding advisory vote at the annual general meeting. This vote enables shareholders to express their views on the remuneration policies adopted and on their implementation .Companies registered in and listed in the UK (or the European Economic Area or NYSE/Nasdaq) have had to, since 2013, offer shareholders a binding vote to approve the remuneration policy, with an advisory vote on the implementation of this. The distinctions between these and a non-binding advisory vote on (or approval of) remuneration must be borne in mind. Most locally-listed companies offer the non-binding vote as per King II.Based on an analysis of their most recent AGMs (in other words, the year to February 15 2017), those Top 100 companies who received votes of less than 75% in favour on the resolution relating to remuneration are:Of the three with the most votes against, two have formally noted feedback from shareholders around remuneration.In its 2016 integrated report, TFG Limited says: We have taken note of comments received from shareholder advisers and our investors that arose from the shareholder approval of the remuneration report for the 2015 financial year.&#8221; The Public Investment Corporation (PIC), with an 11.6673% stake in TFG, confirms it voted against the resolution, in its quarterly disclosure. It states: The remuneration policy has inadequate disclosure around the performance criteria for both the short-term incentives (STI) and long-term incentives (LTI). There is lack of disclosure of weightings, more than one performance indicator and targets. STI has only one performance condition Heps, which can easily be manipulated and the LTI also has one performance condition Heps, which is also inadequate. Best practice recommends that companies must have multiple performance measures to avoid manipulation of results or poor business decisions. Anglo American, says it is mindful of the concerns expressed by a large number of shareholders in relation to executive remuneration in 2015, which have led to the remuneration report (Resolution 16) not receiving the same high level of support compared to previous years. The dialogue which the Company has had with many of its major shareholders leading up to the AGM has helped clarify the issues, and this will continue in the form of further consultation over the coming months ahead of the 2017 AGM, when a revised remuneration policy will be put to the vote. Setting executive remuneration in a volatile industry such as mining can be challenging and the Remuneration Committee intends to again engage with shareholders in order to refine the policy to ensure that it is both appropriate and motivational .It has been under pressure for some time, directly contradicting its claims of a high level of support . In 2015, it received even fewer votes in favour (54.36%), while in 2014 it managed around 60%.The PIC, which owns 10.0399% of Anglo, says its reason for voting against the implementation resolution is: The remuneration policy appears to be inconsistent with the best practice. The Company discloses earnings per share (EPS) as the only indicator for STI plan. PIC recommends that companies should have multiple indicators to avoid manipulation of results .In the case of Telkom, one wonders who else apart from government (39%) and the Public Investment Corporation (11%) voted in favour of the company s remuneration.Mkt cap (Rbn)DateForAgainstAbstainShares voted1AB Inbev 2 394.2427-Apr-1679.320.60.175.72BAT 1 649.9927-Apr-1690.329.683Naspers 924.3026-Aug-1678.618.023.0389.554Glencore 784.3019-May-16Not voted on5Richemont 518.7114-Sep-16&gt;966BHP Billiton 483.2617-Nov-1697.42.699.67Anglo American 321.7421-Apr-1658.4141.597.2861.558Steinhoff 296.1631-May-16Not voted on9FirstRand 292.9829-Nov-16 97.142.8680.510Sasol 250.5725-Nov-1690.939.0781.111Standard Bank 238.6826-May-1684.4815.520.1182.8412Vodacom 224.6519-Jul-1699.20.89113MTN Group 218.1025-May-1667.8132.1878.5114Old Mutual 173.3428-Jun-1693.176.8372.8615Mondi 145.7912-May-1694.325.687616Sanlam 145.1508-Jun-1678.4121.5970.4617South 32 143.2124-Nov-1676.9223.0818Aspen 141.6106-Dec-16 95.824.1819Barclays Africa Group 139.2417-May-16 81.6818.3291.720Remgro 121.5301-Dec-16Not voted on21Nedbank 120.9705-May-16 94.125.8882.9922Shoprite 100.6331-Oct-16 70.2929.7184.2923Mediclinic 100.1820-Jul-16 85.0214.9884.4624RMB Holdings 93.9224-Nov-16 88.8011.276.6225Investec 92.6704-Aug-16 80.2719.737626Anglo American Platinum 91.5108-Apr-16 96.313.6893.7927Capitec 82.4327-May-16 99.420.5878.9428Tiger Brands 81.1516-Feb-16 89.2110.7910029Bid Corp79.4811-Nov-16 98.901.1100 96.103.9100 71.6028.410030Discovery 77.3329-Nov-16 86.0613.9478.2831Woolworths 76.2930-Nov-16 69.9230.0867.7932Growthpoint 75.2815-Nov-16 79.9020.171.733Hammerson 73.3125-Apr-16Not voted on34Anglogold Ashanti 71.5304-May-16 87.1712.8378.7135Kumba Iron Ore 67.4313-May-16 92.187.8291.8236Redefine 62.9709-Feb-17 76.6823.327837Intu 60.4504-May-16Not voted on38RMI 59.7524-Nov-16 74.5725.4376.4639Fortress 58.6501-Nov-16 61.8938.1164.2640PSG Group 57.1224-Jun-16Not voted on41Bidvest 55.5428-Nov-16 99.100.9100 95.264.74100 67.9932.0110042Reinet 55.1230-Aug-16Not voted on43Resilient 49.4231-Oct-16 71.0428.9678.544New Europe Property 48.9212-May-16Not voted on45Netcare 47.2603-Feb-17 90.069.9472.7546Sappi 46.0608-Feb-17 94.715.2982.8947Mr Price 42.4931-Aug-16 84.6615.2148Capital &amp; Counties 40.6606-May-16 97.942.0676.6149Brait 40.6520-Jul-16Not voted on50Pioneer Foods 39.9910-Feb-17 85.3314.6768.5951MMI Holdings 39.8722-Nov-16 68.7131.2981.452Assore 39.7925-Nov-16 93.826.1890.353Impala Platinum 38.8626-Oct-16 74.8425.1672.4354Telkom 37.6226-Aug-16 61.3538.6381.2855Gold Fields 37.5818-May-16 85.0714.921.310056Life Healthcare 36.7125-Jan-17 97.992.0177.157TFG Limited 36.1706-Sep-16 52.7247.287758Truworths 36.0303-Nov-16 79.0520.9576.159Imperial 35.8901-Nov-16 98.881.127260Spar 33.8907-Feb-17 94.495.5172.8561Exxaro 33.8226-May-16 90.809.27962Pick n Pay 33.7025-Jul-16 84.5815.4288.7863AVI 33.1203-Nov-16 97.282.7278.4964Liberty Holdings 32.9120-May-16 99.00188.1665Distell 32.4620-Oct-16 97.562.4490.1966Rockcastle 32.2525-Nov-16Not voted on67Clicks Group 30.4326-Jan-17 98.261.7483.6468Hyprop 30.0101-Dec-16 89.9110.0966.4769Tsogo Sun 28.8619-Oct-16 85.4014.677.0370Massmart 28.8626-May-1684.7215.2889.2571Santam 27.7501-Jun-16 87.1012.910072Sibanye 27.6124-May-16 88.4511.541.0182.473Northam 26.0302-Dec-16 90.039.974.3876.8374Barloworld 24.9308-Feb-17 80.6219.3872.975African Rainbow Minerals 24.8209-Nov-16 87.5012.595.176KAP 23.6930-Nov-16 92.387.6288.1177Coronation 23.2614-Feb-17 84.5915.4179.678EOH 21.1719-Feb-16Not voted on79Dis-Chem 21.10No AGM since listing in late 201680Curro 19.9524-Jun-16Not voted on81Tongaat 17.9727-Jul-1686.5813.4290.8182Oakbay Resources 16.4030-Sep-16100010083Harmony 15.9825-Nov-1691.038.9787.0684Oceana 15.7216-Feb-1790.19.994.185Arcelor Mittal 15.6525-May-1698.371.6385.6486Famous Brands 14.6829-Jul-1668.4831.5171.9587RCL Foods 14.0808-Nov-1691.558.4596.5588SA Corporate Real Estate 13.9020-May-1690.989.0279.1189Italtile 13.9025-Nov-1695.264.748390JSE Limited 13.9026-May-1699.510.4967.4291Attacq 13.8224-Nov-1689.5110.496492Vukile 13.4129-Aug-1661.5738.4369.8193Reunert 13.3813-Feb-1772.4927.5187.1394Globe Trade Cente 13.2124-May-16Not voted on95Super Group 13.1422-Nov-1695.094.9179.1996Zeder 12.7424-Jun-16Not voted on97AECI 12.6730-May-1679.8320.1781.5898HCI 12.5901-Nov-1686.1113.899099Blue Label Telecoms 12.3608-Dec-1697.732.240.0388100Nampak 12.3101-Feb-1797.452.5583.08&nbsp;Of course, the more tightly-held/less-liquid the stock is, the more likely you are to find 99%-plus endorsements. In one not surprising instance, 100% of the 100% present shareholders voted in favour of the company s remuneration policy.It must also be noted that even if a relatively large percentage of shareholders vote in favour of a company s remuneration policy (binding or otherwise), this percentage is almost always lower than votes on other resolutions. In other words, an 85% approval of a remuneration policy will in all likelihood be far lower than the 90%-95% of votes cast in favour on other matters, such as re-election of directors or, even, the authority to repurchase shares.In some cases, abstentions on the remuneration-specific resolution(s) are disclosed (and these are either included in the vote split or excluded).The other vector here is how many shares were actually voted at the AGM. In some cases (like Anglo), this is surprisingly low (61.55%).Two companies (unbundled during 2016) stand out in this analysis: Bidvest and Bid Corporation (Bidcorp). Both offer three (non-binding) votes on remuneration: an endorsement on the company s policy on base package and benefits, its policy on short-term incentives, and its policy on long-term incentivesThis means shareholders can vote far more granularly on these matters. Based on the past two AGMs, shareholders are far less satisfied ( 65% approval) with the company s long-term incentives than issues of base pay and short-term incentives.* Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
