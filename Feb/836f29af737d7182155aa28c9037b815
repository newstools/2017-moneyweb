The African National Congress is preparing to give Brian Molefe, former chief executive officer of state power company Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., a seat in parliament, according to three party officials.Molefe will be given a seat from the North West province after one of its members of Parliament resigned, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified because they aren t authorized to comment on the matter. The Sunday Times reported last month that Molefe has been touted as a possible replacement of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who s been feuding with President Jacob Zuma over the management of state-owned companies and spending on a planned nuclear power programme.Molefe quit Eskom after the nation s Public Protector accused him in a Nov. 2 report of favoring the Gupta family, which is in business with Zuma s son, by allegedly handing them coal-supply contracts and helping them buy Optimum Coal Holdings Ltd. Molefe and Eskom deny wrongdoing.Calls to Molefe s mobile phone didn t connect. 2017 Bloomberg L.P
