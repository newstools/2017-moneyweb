The current deputy executive officer for insurance at the Financial Services Board (FSB), Jonathan Dixon, was on Monday named as the new secretary general of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).IAIS is the international standard setting body for the supervision of the insurance sector. Dixon will be the first person from an emerging economy to take the position of its secretary general. For eight years Jonathan has been a vital part of the FSB management team, FSB executive officer, advocate Dube Tshidi, said in a statement. We are grateful for all his contributions, including the hard work he has put into our move towards Twin Peaks regulation. We wish him everything of the best in his new position, and we are proud of his achievement and how it reflects on the quality of insurance supervision in South Africa. Dixon has been involved with IAIS since 2009 and has served on the organisation&#8217;s executive committee and has chaired the implementation committee. Dixon brings a unique combination of proven insurance supervisory experience with global leadership on key insurance initiatives, said Dr Victoria Saporta, chair of the IAIS Executive Committee. I have worked alongside Jonathan for several years and have been impressed by his commitment to the mission of the IAIS, his pragmatic and proportionate approach to insurance supervision, his inclusiveness in reaching out and building strong partnerships and, ultimately, his track record of delivering on a vision. Dixon will join IAIS from September 1, allowing the FSB time for a smooth transfer of his responsibilities at the local regulator.
