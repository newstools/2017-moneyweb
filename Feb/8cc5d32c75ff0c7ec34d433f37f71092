MultiChoice is hiking the prices of its main DStv bouquets. However, most of the increases this year are relatively modest compared to last year s adjustments.The 2017 increases are mostly below the prevailing consumer inflation rate, and are significantly less than the increases announced in 2016.In a communication with customers, MultiChoice acknowledged that consumers are under pressure because of a tough economic environment and it said it has attempted to keep increases in 2017 to a minimum.The less-steep hikes may also reflect the growing competition from internet streaming rivals such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and ShowMax, a sister company to MultiChoice in the Naspers stable.Another factor is that cost pressures on MultiChoice have lessened significantly since last year s steep price hikes thanks to the strength of the rand against international currencies, especially the US dollar.Since the last price adjustment was announced, on March 1 2016, the rand has improved by almost 25% against the greenback. The purchase of foreign programming, often in US dollars, is a significant cost driver in MultiChoice s business.From April 1 2017, the price of DStv Premium the company s top-end bouquet will rise to R789/month from R759/month now, an increase of 4%, it said in the communication to customers. Last year, MultiChoice hiked the price of DStv Premium by more than twice that by 8.6% from R699/month to R759/month.DStv Extra will increase on April 1 2017 by 6.5% to R489/month from R459/month now, while DStv Compact customers will have to fork out R365/month, a 5.8% increase over the R345/month currently charged. The 2016 increases for Extra and Compact were 8% and 8.2% respectively.DStv Access and EasyView customers will be pleased to learn that the prices of the two bouquets remain unchanged at R99/month and R29/month respectively. However, DStv Indian and Portuguesa subscribers will have to cough up more from April 1.The DStv Indian bouquet will rise to R360/month, from R340/month now, while an add-on Indian bouquet, offering even more channels, will cost R229/month, from R220/month now. Portuguesa subscribers will in future pay R465/month, from R445/month now, with add-on channels rising from R220/month to R299/month.The personal video recorder access fee remains unchanged at R85/month, as do BoxOffice rentals (R35/title) and decoder insurance, MultiChoice said in its communication with customers.This article was first published on TechCentral.
