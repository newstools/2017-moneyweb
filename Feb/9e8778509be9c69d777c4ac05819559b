It was the culmination of a journey that started with being a shelf-packer and traversed through various positions in blue chip companies such as Distell and SABMiller, where he worked with iconic leaders.However, while Hedderwick s career path has delivered a finely-tuned corporate business knowledge and a sharp instinct for human capital, the systems around it and the successful implementation of process, he is also a rebel entrepreneur.
