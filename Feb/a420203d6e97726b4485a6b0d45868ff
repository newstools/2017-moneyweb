If the argument that the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica) has no authority over trainee accountants is accepted, it could have huge implications for a number of trainees who have already been sanctioned for sharing of information in preparation for the 2015 Assessment of Professional Competence (APC) exam.Adv. Frans Barrie SC put the argument to a Saica disciplinary committee last week in defence of trainee accountant Dene Smuts who has been charged by Saica after she shared two documents from the Clinix Hospital Group audit file during the exam pre-release period with two colleagues at PwC where they were all employed at the time.Smuts tried to remove all the confidential client information from the document, before she sent it to her colleagues, but missed two Word Art images depicting the Clinix logo, the names of junior Clinix staff members and some tariff codes that Smuts contends would have been of no use to anybody and patient names. One of the colleagues distributed the documents further outside the firm, where after the documents went viral. He also identified the client in the covering e-mail and was sanctioned for doing so.The number of trainees affected is not known and Saica has refused to give details until all disciplinary processes have been finalised. It did disclose that 2 709 candidates took the APC exam, that is the second half of the Qualifying Examination (QE), which is a prerequisite to qualify for registration as a chartered accountant registered with Saica.According to testimony during Smuts hearing, PwC alone disciplined 84 of its 450 trainee accountants for the events. Ten were fired.Moneyweb learnt that in addition to withholding the 2015 APC results of several trainee accountants found guilty by the Disciplinary Committee, Saica has prohibited them from retaking the exam before 2017. This sets back their careers considerably.Pro forma prosecutor Dario Milo from the attorneys Webber Wentzel asked the committee to punish Smuts harshly for what he considered to be her obstructive conduct during the hearing and her lack of appreciation for the fundamental principle of client confidentiality.He asked that she be ordered to pay a R50 000 contribution to the cost of the hearing, that lasted four days, her registration as Chartered Accountant be suspended for a year from the date she becomes eligible to register and that the finding be published without disclosing her nameThis is in contrast with the offer of a plea bargain that was made to Smuts earlier of a R5 000 contribution to cost, four-month suspension and publication of the finding without her name.Barrie argued that Saica has no jurisdiction to discipline trainee accountants. He contended that Saica is a member organisation and members are defined as chartered accountants, which trainees clearly are not.He pointed out that there was no agreement between her and Saica before the panel and even if such a document stated that she would submit to Saica s rules, it would not automatically follow that Saica has the authority to discipline her. He said it could be a matter of breach of contract to be dealt with as such.He further questioned whether authority was properly delegated to the Disciplinary Committee and whether the processes followed were compliant with the Saica Constitution.Barrie earlier also objected to the pro forma prosecutor cross examining Smuts as the process is meant to be inquisitorial, rather than adversarial. Committee chair adv. Mohammed Chohan overruled his objection after obtaining a legal opinion, but Smuts nevertheless refused to answer questions put to her by Milo.Barrie stated that Smuts did not breach client confidentiality in terms of the Saica Code of Conduct as this applied to the relationship between the client and PwC. She did not send the documents outside her firm.He said she earlier pleaded guilty before a PwC disciplinary panel because she admitted that she breached her agreement with her employer by sharing client information with colleagues outside the Clinix audit team. PwC acknowledged that she tried to sanitise the documents and sanctioned her for negligence only by giving her a written warning.Milo said if there is agreement about the facts of the case, Smuts has to be found guilty of contravening the Saica Code of Conduct, which would mean she acted irregularly in terms of the bylaws and APC rules.He said the case is about the fundamental ethical principle of confidentiality, which is one of five principles fundamental to the auditing profession. Smuts, he said, has in fact regressed in her understanding of confidentiality since she pleaded guilty before PwC. She was the factual cause of the documents ending up outside the firm. She was the keys to the vault, he said.He said earlier testimony about a contract between Smuts and Saica was not challenged and should therefore be accepted. She further signed an acknowledgement of the APC regulations and is therefore bound to it.He pointed out that Chohan as chair person could still request documents and affidavits to confirm the link between Smuts and Saica that would give the organisation the necessary jurisdiction.The committee will announce its ruling in due course.
