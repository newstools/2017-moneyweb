An outbreak of fall armyworms that has attacked corn plants in South Africa may spread to sugarcane in the KwaZulu-Natal province, where a warm climate would help the pest survive through the year, the Agricultural Research Council said.The alien pest, confirmed in South Africa this month, has already spread to all nine provinces including eastern KwaZulu-Natal, where the bulk of cane is grown in the nation. There aren t yet any reports of infestations, Roger Price, a manager at the Pretoria-based ARC, said in an e-mailed reply to questions on Thursday. We are very concerned that fall armyworms will get into the sugarcane along the KwaZulu-Natal coast, where it could persist in the warmer climatic conditions, he said. My personal view is that the vast bulk of the commercial maize crop has not been damaged and that national food security is not currently at risk. The armyworms, which arrived in west Africa from the Americas early in 2016, spread south through Zambia and Zimbabwe before arriving in Africa s biggest producer of corn, the region s staple food. 2017 Bloomberg
