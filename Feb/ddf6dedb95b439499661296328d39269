Capital &amp; Counties Properties wrote down the value of its land holdings in west London by 20%, less than expected by some analysts, as higher taxes and political uncertainty weaken sentiment in the UK capital s housing market.The company, which plans to build 10 000 homes at Earls Court with venture partners, cut the value of its sites in the district to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) from 1.4 billion pounds a year earlier, according to a statement on Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. had estimated a write down of 30%. The reduction in Earls Court was driven mainly by a higher assumed developer s margin for consented development land, trimming of sales values as well as some cost inflation, JPMorgan analyst Neil Green wrote in a note to clients.CapCo s shares climbed as much as 4.2% the highest since the day after the Brexit vote, and closed 4.07% higher in London.
