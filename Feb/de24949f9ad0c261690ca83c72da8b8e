CAPE TOWN &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s African Equity Empowerment Investments will list its fishing and food unit on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on March 2 to grow its market share, its chief executive said on Wednesday.Khalid Abdulla said the firm expected the Initial Public Offering (IPO) to value the unit at around R1.2 billion ($90 million) and that the cash &#8220;war chest&#8221; from the IPO will be used for further growth and acquisitions.&#8220;We will be raising about R550 million with the listing and obviously we will use that money to grow the business further, to buy other fishing and food-related businesses,&#8221; Abdulla told Reuters in an interview.&#8220;We will have a nice war chest to go and build this business to another level,&#8221; he said.He said the company, South Africa&#8217;s largest black-owned and managed fishing and food firm, will be placing about 45-49% of Premier&#8217;s share on the market, with each share selling for approximately R4.50.Headquarted in Cape Town, Premier Food and Fishing said during its 2016 end-of-year results that operating profit rose by 37% to R74 million on the back of higher sales and good catch rates. Abdulla said the firm would initially be looking for acquisition opportunities in the fishing sector that complement Premier&#8217;s existing portfolio of species &#8211; where it holds medium to long-term quotas for west coast rock lobster, squid, pilchards and hake.He said Premier&#8217;s empowerment credentials, part of government policy to spread wealth to the majority of blacks excluded during white-minority rule, should stand it in good stead when buying other companies.
