JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed early on Wednesday, with the market focus on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s budget speech due later in the day.At 0928 GMT, the rand traded at 13.0850 per dollar, up 0.4% on its New York close of 13.1425 on Tuesday.&#8220;Risk currencies as has been the case since the US election are held back by corresponding dollar gains but are nevertheless edging stronger and this should feed into similar rand gains. Caution in front of today&#8217;s event risk will probably restrict any significant moves,&#8221; RMB Global Markets analyst John Cairns wrote in a note.Gordhan, who is widely respected in financial markets, will deliver his budget speech at 1200 GMT.&#8220;A budget in line with our expectations should not move the market significantly,&#8221; said Cairns.Stocks opened slightly stronger, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 index up 0.11%.In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was firmer, shedding 3 basis points to 8.77%.
