LONDON &#8211; European shares fell on Thursday in early deals, weighed down by healthcare stocks after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump targeted pharmaceuticals&#8217; drug pricing in a press conference.Europe&#8217;s healthcare sector index dropped 2.2 percent, the biggest sectoral faller, and headed for its biggest loss since November. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.5 percent.Trump on Wednesday commented on the need for competitive drug pricing, saying pharmaceutical companies were &#8220;getting away with murder&#8221; by charging high drug prices.&#8220;The healthcare companies in Europe are quite interconnected with the U.S. so Trump&#8217;s comments bode badly for the sector,&#8221; said Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group.Biotechnology was a top gainer in the last bull rally so traditional market rotation dictates it should not lead the Trump rally in any case, Lawler said. &#8220;A hostile policy [on healthcare] just adds extra pressure.&#8221;Pharmaceuticals companies Novo Nordisk, Inmarsat and BTG were the top STOXX fallers, with Novo smarting from a U.S. class action lawsuit, down 5.3 percent.Britain&#8217;s Jupiter Fund Management also slumped, down 5.4 percent after reporting that clients pulled 373 million pounds ($456 million) from its funds during the fourth quarter, largely exiting European and multi-manager strategies.Italy&#8217;s UBI Banca was top of the STOXX, gaining 11 percent on news the bank would buy three rescued Italian banks through a 400 million euro share issue.Swiss luxury goods group Richemont was also a top European gainer, its shares jumping 8 percent and heading for their biggest one-day gain in nearly four years, after its trading update indicated a pick-up in demand for watches and jewellery. Peer Swatch Group also gained 5 percent.Britain&#8217;s blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.2 percent, with retailers Tesco and AB Foods top fallers despite results being in line with forecasts. Peer Sainsbury was also down 2 percent.&#8220;Tesco stock still has fulsome recovery earnings multiples, the equity does not yet yield a dividend and on a pension and lease adjusted basis the solvency ratios are still high in an absolute and relative context,&#8221; said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.&#8220;Accordingly, we see this as a good statement, albeit perhaps not good enough for the &#8216;uber&#8217; bulls.&#8221;Rival supermarket Marks &amp; Spencer was up 2.5 percent after a strong Christmas trading update.Basic resources and precious metals miners once again led the index, boosted by a weaker dollar, with Randgold Resources , Fresnillo, and Anglo American top gainers.
