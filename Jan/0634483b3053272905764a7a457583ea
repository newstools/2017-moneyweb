LONDON &#8211; Sterling saw its biggest gains since the 2008 financial crisis on Tuesday as Prime Minister Theresa May promised a parliamentary vote on Britain&#8217;s deal to leave the EU and said it would seek to stay a key European partner.The pound, already up more than 1 percent as May began a keenly-awaited speech that had been extensively leaked to media, surged 2.5 percent on the day to a 10-day high of $1.2343 in the minutes that followed.It gained more than 1.5 percent to 86.69 pence per euro, with dealers reporting a widespread squeeze on short positions &#8211; or bets against sterling &#8211; taken in derivatives markets in the past few days.One media report at the weekend had quoted a Downing Street source as predicting May&#8217;s speech would trigger a significant correction in the pound. Until Tuesday&#8217;s action most had assumed that would be downward not upward.&#8220;Theresa May&#8217;s greatest trick appears to have been to deliver what amounts to a fairly hard Brexit message without the markets going into a flat spin,&#8221; said ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson.&#8220;Some judicious leaks in the last couple of days had primed investors for the UK to be leaving the single market. Many expected a tough sounding speech that would send the pound lower.&#8221;The FTSE 100 share index, which has tended to rise as sterling dropped in a series of sell-offs since the vote for Brexit last June, extended an early fall led by exporters and mining companies as May spoke.May said she wanted to avoid a &#8220;disruptive cliff edge&#8221; for businesses when Britain leaves the European Union and backed a phasing-in of changes in immigration, customs and regulation in areas such as financial services.Analysts and traders said they expected more meat once the talks get under way after Britain triggers the EU&#8217;s Article 50 exit process in March.&#8220;May&#8217;s speech did not have anything new that was not already known. However, with the pound bouncing, the dollar earners are coming under pressure,&#8221; said Jawaid Afsar, a senior trader at broker Securequity.&#8220;The speech has given some direction, but the real test will come when Article 50 is triggered. Stay tuned for a bumpy Brexit ride.&#8221;Gilt yields, which have been falling as expectations for future UK growth suffered from concerns over the EU exit talks, rose around 2 basis points to 1.275 percent for 10-year paper.Overnight implied volatility &#8211; a measure of expected swings in the pound expressed through currency options &#8211; halved from six-month highs hit on Monday to 13.788 percent. One-week volatility fell from 15.5 percent to around 11.4 percent.&#8220;There was a lot of bad news in the market &#8211; people were positioned all one way, so there was always a risk (of a squeeze on those positions),&#8221; said Ian Gunner, a portfolio manager with Altana in London.&#8220;Some people will say &#8216;this is a hard Brexit, however she wants to dress it up&#8217;, and there will be criticisms from various politicians. But it&#8217;s a clean Brexit, and that&#8217;s the most important thing.&#8221;
