South African bullion producer Harmony Gold said on Thursday that 1,700 miners were staging a wildcat sit-in at its Kusasalethu mine west of Johannesburg, an operation that has been a flashpoint of labour unrest and violence in the past.The sit-in began on Wednesday when employees failed to return to the surface at the end of the morning shift.Harmony said in a statement late on Thursday that the strikers, who have brought production at the mine to a standstill, had finally issued a set of demands and that the strike was continuing.&#8220;Formal demands have been received, which include payment of a special bonus, the removal of the general manager and an assurance that disciplinary action would not be pursued,&#8221; the company said.&#8220;Management has continued to appeal to employees to return to surface in the interests of safety and health, and to engage on the issues of concern through established processes.&#8221;The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) is the majority union at the mine and most of the strikers are AMCU members.&#8220;Harmony CEO, Peter Steenkamp, has appealed to AMCU to continue displaying responsible leadership and to work with management to resolve the situation swiftly and safely,&#8221; the company said. AMCU officials could not be reached for comment.The company also said that eighteen employees who were suffering severe fatigue and dehydration had been brought to the surface and had received medical treatment.Kusasalethu, which has around 4,500 employees, produced just over 124,000 ounces of gold in the 2016 financial year and the company said in August it was reducing its life to five years from 24 because grades were expected to become much lower.
