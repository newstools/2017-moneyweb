If you re over the age of 55, you should be paying nothing for your banking if you re on the right account and hold a minimum balance, of course! South Africa s four large full-service retail banks all offer day-to-day current accounts targeted at seniors, and because of &#8220;rebate&#8221; banking, they are effectively free.AbsaFNBFlexi Account (Seniors offering)Encore GoldMinimum balance for fees rebateR5 000No minimum balance maintainedR10 000No minimum balance maintainedAnnual cheque card service fee Monthly feeFreeR16FreeR65Cash withdrawal (Own ATM)FreeR3.95 + R1.35/R1004 free, thereafter R1.85/R100Cash withdrawal (Other ATM)R9.95 + R1.35/R100R7 + R1.85/R100Cash withdrawal (Point of Sale)FreeR3.95FreeCash deposit (Automated deposit own ATM)R3.95 + R1.35/R100Free up to R6000 per month, thereafter 80c/R100Purchase/Swipe (Point of Sale)FreeR2.65FreeInternal debit orderFreeFreeFreeExternal debit orderFreeR8.50FreeBalance enquiry (Own ATM)FreeR1.50FreePrepaid airtime top-up (electronic channels)R1.15FreeDebit card replacementR120R130 (R85 for non-personalised card)&nbsp;NedbankStandard BankOptimum Current AccountConsolidator (Bundle)Consolidator (Pay-As-You-Transact)Minimum balance for fees rebateR10000 in fixed/notice deposit or JustSave accountNo minimum balance maintained&gt;R10000 = rebate of R85, &gt;R20000 = rebate of R125, &gt;R30000 = rebate of R225Annual cheque card service feeR169* Monthly feeFreeR20R45 Cash withdrawal (Own ATM)4 free, thereafter R4.50 + R1.40/R100R4.50 + R1.40/R1004 freeR1.80/R100Cash withdrawal (Other ATM)R11.50 + R1.40/R100R6.70 + R1.80/R100Cash withdrawal (Point of Sale)FreeR4UnlimitedR1.80Cash deposit (Automated deposit own ATM)R2.75 + 35c/R100R5.50 + 70c/R1003 freeR1.80/R100Purchase/Swipe (Point of Sale)FreeR4UnlimitedFreeInternal debit orderFreeR5UnlimitedR4.50External debit orderFreeR16UnlimitedR16Balance enquiry (Own ATM)FreeFreeUnlimitedDisplay free, print R1.50Prepaid airtime top-up (electronic channels)FreeFreeR1.10Debit card replacementR130R130* Debit card has no annual feeAbsa, with its Flexi Account for seniors, requires the lowest minimum balance to be maintained for a rebate on fees. Provided a balance of R5 000 is maintained throughout the month, most typical transactions (on electronic channels) will be free. Only prepaid airtime purchases will attract a fee. FNB requires a minimum balance of R10 000 for a rebate on its monthly bundled account fee of R65, by far the priciest of the four banks. However, most transactions (cash withdrawals (four per month), point of sale purchases, debit orders, cash deposits (free up to R6 000 per month) and airtime purchases) are included in this &#8220;flat&#8221; fee which is not the case at rivals. You won t be penalised for branch or cheque transactions, with a combination of five of these being free per month.Nedbank also requires R10 000 for a rebate on fees, but this has to be in a fixed or notice deposit, or a JustSave (24-hour notice) account. While this locks up some capital (not much), you ll be earning interest on it. The bank s electronic OptimumPlus fixed deposit offering for seniors currently pays interest of 8.6% on a balance of R10 000 over 12 months so, not only will you get a rebate on fees, you ll earn some interest on the money (JustSave pays just 3.9%). Fees for most electronic transactions are waived with the minimum deposit and only cash deposits (even on the bank s own automated cash-accepting ATMs) will attract a charge. Customers would do well to avoid the (hybrid) cheque card as this attracts a R169 annual service fee. The vanilla debit card has no annual fee.Standard Bank offers rebates in various tiers, starting at a balance of R10 000 (R85 back for fees). R20 000 nets you a rebate of R125, while R30 000 means R225 back for fees. Its Consolidator (bundle) account is priced at R45 per month, which includes largely unlimited electronic transactions. Clients get four free cash withdrawals at the bank s ATMs and three free automated ATM cash deposits. Even with &#8220;out-of-bundle&#8221; transactions, a balance of more than R10 000 (meaning a rebate of R85) should more than cover a month s typical usage.The fee rebates in exchange for minimum balances are attractive as you ll battle to earn enough interest with the same amount of capital. Sticking R10 000 into a Capitec savings account, for example, will earn you approximately R65 per month at current interest rates (7.75%). You ll be better off and it ll be far less hassle on one of these current accounts, utilising the rebate option.Ensuring you aren t paying any bank charges will rely on three things: making sure you ve got the correct account (for over-55s), that you have the required minimum balance for the fees rebate and that you stick to electronic, own-bank channels for transactions.Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
