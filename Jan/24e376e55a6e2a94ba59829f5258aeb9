As a result, the company expects headline earnings per share (Heps) to decrease by between 2.5% to 7.5% to between 234.5 to 247.2 cents per share for the period. But earnings per share (EPS) will rise by between 30% to 40% to between 329.8 to 355.2 cents per share, due to the profit on disposal by David Jones of its Market Street property in Sydney.The Woolworths debtors book grew by 2.3% at the end of December.
