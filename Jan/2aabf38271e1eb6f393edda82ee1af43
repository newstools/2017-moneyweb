A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd., the LME s owner, couldn t comment beyond confirming that trading had resumed.The fault occurred at the start of the trading day in China, the world s biggest consumer of metals.

Most of the time, Chinese traders just wait until it opens. Unless there is big movement on the Shanghai futures exchange which leads to arbitrage trading opportunities. Then they will call to make trades.
