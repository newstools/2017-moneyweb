JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African retail sales rose by 3.8 percent year-on-year in November, following a decline of 0.2 percent in October, data from the statistics office showed on Wednesday.Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.4 percent year-on-year decrease in November.On a month-on-month basis, sales rose by 3.5 percent, and ticked up 1.8 percent in the three months to November compared with the same period last year, Statistics South Africa said.Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, comments: 2016 was a worrying year for retailers in South Africa, with new credit regulations restricting the industry and consumers across the country strapped for cash. Yet, today s numbers showing an uptick in spending for November could be the green shoots of recovery heading into 2017. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who has had a rollercoaster year, will be hoping that figures like this will help accelerate growth at the World Bank s new 1.1 percent-a-year forecast. December s festive trading figures are now eagerly anticipated, with any notable jump expected to invite in investors, says Sirani.
