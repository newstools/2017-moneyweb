Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) and BrightBlack Energy are to fund rooftop solar energy solutions for the commercial and industrial sector through a joint initiative, First Energy Alternatives.The parties contributed a combined R100 million to the initiative, which is likely to plug the funding gap for commercial solar solutions in the market.Corporate and investment banks are unlikely to take on relatively low-value solar projects, which range from R2 million to R40 million, while some retail banks appear to lack the technical understanding to structure appropriate deals, said Greg McKenzie, a dealmaker at RMB. A one megawatt project can cost anything from R10 million to R14 million that s not going to be of any interest to corporate and investment banks. The funding terms and financing agreements for these projects, which can run up to 15 years, is unheard of in corporate and investment banking. It s not worth it to structure the deal as no one will bite, he said.Instead, he said First Energy Alternatives will aggregate multiple rooftop solar projects in the commercial and industrial space to build a portfolio of around R500 million to R 1 billion, against which it will secure debt financing.According to Wessel Wessels, CEO of BrightBlack Energy, the initiatives portfolio of viable projects is likely to hit the R500 million mark within the next 12 months to 16 months. Our current pipeline is already close to that number. A number of big corporates, manufacturing firms and property portfolio companies, that manage retail malls, are interested in coming on-board, he said. He identified setting up rooftop solar projects at retail malls as a sweet spot for the company. It can generate enough power to meet around 30% to 40% of the mall&#8217;s needs it cannot generate too much power as there are no feed-in tariffs in South Africa and as power consumption is in line with daylight hours.For now, First Energy Alternatives is focusing on solar solutions but may broaden its mandate to include other similar schemes, McKenzie said.He said that the entire FirstRand Group is likely to work across the spectrum over time, with FNB likely to offer retail banking solutions to customers seeking solar energy solutions. Such solutions may include adding the cost of financing rooftop solar energy solutions to home loans.
