The European Union will work to ensure the UK won t be in a better position after Brexit, the European Parliament s negotiator said.UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced a very radical Brexit because she knows that the European Union will never accept a situation in which the status of a country outside the union is more favourable than to be a member of the European Union, Guy Verhofstadt said on Wednesday in Washington.With Britain preparing to trigger the formal start of negotiations in March, both sides are laying out their initial positions. Rhetoric has intensified since May talked up a trade deal with the US and hinted that the UK could slash corporate tax rates.May flies to the US on Thursday and is expected to hold preliminary discussions on trade with President Donald Trump in the White House on Friday. She wants a quick deal with America to bolster exports, boost British jobs and strengthen her negotiating position as the UK prepares to leave the EU. Verhofstadt said the election of Trump, who has spoken out in favour of Brexit, was a wake-up call for the EU.Verhofstadt, who is representing the EU Parliament on Brexit, said the remaining 27 governments were united in making sure Britain can t pick off the best parts of EU membership. While the European assembly doesn t have a direct say in the negotiations, it does have to give its consent to any final deal. It s not a question of revenge or punishment; they have taken their decision so we need a fair, clear agreement, Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, told an audience at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US.He reiterated that the negotiations need to take no more than 15 months once May activates the EU s Article 50 because of the period necessary for the EU Parliament to give its approval. 2017 Bloomberg
