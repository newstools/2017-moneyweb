U.K. inflation accelerated more than economists forecast in December as signs mounted that the pound s decline is leading to a surge in import costs.Consumer-price growth increased to 1.6 percent, the highest since July 2014, from 1.2 percent in November. That beat the 1.4 percent median forecast of economists. A separate report showed the cost of imports soared at the fastest annual rate in more than five years.The data comes a day after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that U.K. consumers are facing fresh headwinds this year as sterling s 18 percent depreciation since the Brexit vote pushes up prices. The BOE, which will publish new forecasts next month, currently expects inflation to breach its 2 percent target within months.The U.K. s core rate of inflation &#8212; excluding volatile food and energy &#8212; picked up to 1.6 percent in December, the fastest since August 2014, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation based on a separate measure, the retail prices index, reached the strongest since July 2014.The cost of imports rose 16.9 percent year-on-year in December, the most since July 2011. Annual growth in factories costs accelerated to 15.8 percent, also a five-year high.As the BOE assesses the outlook and balances its growth and inflation priorities, it says the next move in interest rates could either be a tightening or a loosening. It cut the benchmark rate in August after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, lowering it to a record-low 0.25 percent.Economic developments depend heavily on the U.K. s new trading relationship with the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to set out her plans in a speech on Tuesday. That could include Britain leaving the bloc s single market for goods and services. 2017 Bloomberg L.P
