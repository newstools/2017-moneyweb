Eskom is hoping to get itself out of the municipal debt trap by taking over electricity metering and revenue collection in defaulting municipalities.This will however add another layer of cost, as such municipalities would have to pay Eskom a service fee and several other fees.In a presentation dated December 19 2016 that Moneyweb has seen, Eskom makes the proposal that would see it collect electricity revenue in affected municipalities, keep what it is owed for bulk services and applicable fees and pay the balance to the relevant municipality.Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe has confirmed to Moneyweb that this proposal would be presented at the next meeting of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee for Public Enterprises.The joint meeting of portfolio committee and the Select Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs was scheduled for Thursday January 26, to discuss Eskom s electricity cuts to defaulting municipalities. It is during this meeting that Eskom was hoping to present its proposal.In a statement last week the Democratic Alliance said the meeting was however cancelled, as ANC members would rather attend a lekgotla . A new date has not yet been confirmed, but Phasiwe said it might take place a day earlier, on Wednesday.This is against the background of an statement issued by Eskom on January 22. Eskom announced that it would proceed to cut electricity supply to a list of 22 defaulting municipalities during the morning and evening peak periods. Since then several of the municipalities have come to an agreement with Eskom and their names were taken off this list.Last week public enterprises minister Lynne Brown, who represents government as sole shareholder in Eskom, requested the utility to suspend the power cuts until the end of the month, and Eskom agreed.According to Phasiwe the proposal Eskom will make in Parliament follows after the provincial governments of North West, the Free State and Mpumalanga called on Eskom to take over the electricity supply in the struggling municipalities.He told Moneyweb this is meant to be a temporary measure, as electricity distribution is a municipal competency in terms of the Constitution.The presentation Moneyweb has seen paints a dark and rapidly-worsening situation with regard to municipal debt to Eskom:According to the presentation a provincial inter-ministerial task team proposed the following:Eskom further proposes that it takes over the revenue collection in the relevant municipalities. It will secure funding and convert all customers to smart prepaid meters, collect the revenue at municipal tariffs, take what is due to Eskom and pay over to the municipalities what is due to them .Eskom says it will provide the service at a nominal fee, including a leasing fee for the meters, provide technical training to municipal staff and assist the municipalities with the design of their electricity tariffs.The advantages of the switch to smart meters include that it will allow for the integration of independent power producers, start the build-up towards smart grids, allow for demand side management, reduce electricity theft and improve cash flow as a result of upfront payment, Eskom states in its presentation.Eskom will recover the funding it provides for the smart meters over a pre-determined period through the meter leasing fee and at the end of the period the ownership of the meter will be transferred to the municipality.Municipal customers will buy electricity directly from local Eskom vendors at the municipal tariff or via telephone or the internet. The vending commission and administration fee will be recovered from the municipality. In this regard Eskom proposes a vending commission of 4.83c/kWh +15%.Over and above the meter leasing fee, the municipality will be charged a monthly meter maintenance fee based on 2.2% of the replacement cost of the meter.Eskom will collect the revenue and retain all these fees as well as the bulk electricity cost and pay the balance to the municipality.Eskom in its presentation adds that municipal tariffs need to increase to improve the municipalities financial situation and they would need their equitable share from government to eradicate the overdue debt to Eskom. It further states that the solution might not be viable in all municipalities and a proper analysis has to be done in each municipality to determine its suitability in each case.
