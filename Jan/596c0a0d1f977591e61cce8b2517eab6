Over the past ten years, investors in South African-domiciled unit trusts have generally enjoyed fairly good returns. Excluding money market funds, 92.78% of all local funds with ten-year track records have delivered inflation-beating performance over this period.However, this statistic looks very different over the short term. For the one year period to the end of December 2016, only 23.99% of funds produced real returns in other words outperformed inflation.All South African-domiciled unit trusts&nbsp;Total number of fundsNumber of funds that beat inflationPercentageOne year99223823.99%Ten years34632192.78%Source: MorningstarOne could argue that this just shows that last year was quite poor for investors. However, it does also make the point that the longer you stay invested, the better your chances of earning a real return on your money.This is particularly true for funds that invest primarily in growth assets like listed equity. When comparing returns over a number of time periods, it is quite apparent that your chances of seeing real returns are much higher if you stay invested for at least five years.The tables below show the relative performance of funds in three local unit trust categories multi-asset high-equity, multi-asset flexible, and equity general. These categories were chosen as they have the greatest exposure to equities. The analysis shows how many funds in each category delivered real returns over six different time periods.South Africa Multi-Asset High-Equity&nbsp;Total number of fundsNumber of funds that beat inflationPercentageOne year157106.37%Two years1262519.84%Three years1046865.38%Five years807897.50%Seven years575596.49%Ten years423890.48%Source: MorningstarSouth Africa Multi-Asset Flexible&nbsp;Total number of fundsNumber of funds that beat inflationPercentageOne year651726.15%Two years631726.98%Three years572849.12%Five years484695.83%Seven years444295.45%Ten years302893.33%Source: MorningstarSouth Africa Equity General&nbsp;Total number of fundsNumber of funds that beat inflationPercentageOne year1623119.14%Two years143149.79%Three years1225242.62%Five years989192.86%Seven years827895.12%Ten years595491.52%Source: MorningstarAcross all three categories, five years is a clear inflection point. It is from this period that an investor&#8217;s chances of seeing a real return go above 90%, and stay there.There is admittedly a small shortcoming in this analysis in that it doesn&#8217;t take survivorship bias into account. In other words, funds that have closed down aren&#8217;t taken into consideration and in many cases those funds would have closed because they were poor performers.However, the difference between short-term and long-term performance is still stark. Even though returns over one- or two-years may be poor, if you stay invested you are likely to be rewarded.It is also noticeable that the multi-asset high-equity funds show much better relative returns over three years than flexible or pure equity funds. As they are generally more diversified across different asset classes you would expect their medium-term performance to be more stable, and the tables show that this is the case. Even in this category, however, the likelihood of seeing real returns increases significantly after five years.The lesson here is that patience is a key part of successful investing. What happens over the short term might seem alarming, but if you stay invested and let time do its work, your chances of growing your real worth become a lot better.
