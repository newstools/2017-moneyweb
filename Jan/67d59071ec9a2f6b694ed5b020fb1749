LONDON &#8211; A weaker dollar helped to push up gold on Friday, putting the metal on track for a third straight weekly increase, though gains were capped by profit-taking on long positions.Spot gold edged 0.1 percent higher at $1,196.08 an ounce by 1058 GMT, up 2 percent on the week.But the metal was unable to maintain a seven-week high of $1,206.98 touched in the previous session after President-elect Donald Trump had failed to elaborate on U.S. fiscal stimulus plans at a chaotic news conference, triggering demand for safe-haven gold.Investors took the opportunity to cash in bets on higher prices, said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler. &#8220;There&#8217;s clearly plenty of new long positioning that has come into the market, and at these (price) levels there&#8217;s room to take profit,&#8221; he said.Gold has risen 6.5 percent since a mid-December low. U.S. gold futures were down 0.2 percent at $1,196.90. The dollar, which hit a five-week low on Thursday after Trump&#8217;s comments, weakened 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies, making gold cheaper for non-U.S. investors.The higher gold price depressed physical gold sales in Asia this week as buyers stayed on the sidelines and premiums remained mostly unchanged. In India, the world&#8217;s second-largest consumer of the metal, higher prices prompted retail buyers to postpone purchases for wedding season. Investors were looking ahead to Trump&#8217;s inauguration on Jan. 20, when he is expected to finally provide detail on the infrastructure and spending plans that have driven a rally in U.S. assets. Such details could revive the rally and weaken the gold price, Mitsubishi&#8217;s Butler said.&#8220;Trump&#8217;s economic policies, in particular tax cuts for corporates, could lead to ever-higher equity valuations that divert funds away from bullion and into higher-return assets,&#8221; he said. Analysts at Scotiabank, however, said they expect gold to strengthen further if support at $1,178 an ounce holds. Several Fed officials on Thursday cautioned that Trump&#8217;s fiscal and tax plans could spur a short-term economic boost that would result in longer-run inflation and debt problems, potentially raising demand for gold as an inflation hedge. Among other precious metals, spot silver was flat at $16.77, having hit its highest in almost a month at $16.92 in the previous session. The metal has gained 1.8 percent this week. Platinum was down 0.1 percent at $971.15. It touched a two-month high of $990.10 the previous day. Palladium fell by 0.3 percent to $754.18.
