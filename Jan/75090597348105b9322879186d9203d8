But borrowing costs retreated from record highs, with overnight yuan deposit rates falling to around 10 percent from Friday&#8217;s high of 87 percent.In recent weeks the Chinese authorities have intervened in both onshore and offshore currency markets by selling dollars aggressively to prevent the yuan from depreciating too quickly, with Trump vowing to label China a currency manipulator.Data released at the weekend showed China&#8217;s foreign exchange reserves fell for a sixth consecutive month in December to near-six year lows of $3.011 trillion.Central bank adviser Fan Gong said the decline in forex reserves was good news in the long-run, adding that the yuan had been overvalued for the last three or four years.Chinese mainland stocks were up about 0.5 percent and Hong Kong shares rose 0.25 percent, with China confident it reached 6.7 percent economic growth in 2016.The Russian rouble weakened 0.6 percent versus the dollar and Moscow dollar-denominated stocks retreated 0.8 percent with oil prices falling 1.7 percent to around $56 a barrel.Trump has now accepted that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election and may take action in response.
