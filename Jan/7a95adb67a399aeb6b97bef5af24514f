The potential effect of US President-Elect Donald Trump on South Africa is unclear, says South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago.This, as the US policy outlook remains uncertain mere days before Trump&#8217;s inauguration, he told Bloomberg Daybreak: Americas on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. What we are facing now is an increasing environment of uncertainty, which makes determining policy a significant challenge, he said.Should the US economy grow as a result of a widely-anticipated fiscal policy stimulus, the dollar will strengthen. This, in turn, will affect emerging market economies such as South Africa.Kganyago told Bloomberg that the effects of a stronger dollar on emerging markets would be felt, at first, in trade and finance. In the former, exports should become more competitive while an appreciation of the dollar would lead to rising debt burdens for finance sector players with dollar-denominated debt. If the US economy is also beginning to grow, it might be giving the Fed (US Federal Reserve) room to normalise monetary policy faster, which would lead to a further reversal in capital flows to emerging markets, he said.In light of Trump s concerns that the US dollar is too high, Kganyago said some of the US policies being talked about could, if implemented, lead to an even stronger dollar.He said the Sarb assessed the potential effects of a fiscal stimulus in the US, by using similar channels as those used to assess the normalisation of US monetary policy. It would lead to an appreciating dollar, which would lead to a realignment in exchange rates globally and, from a monetary policy perspective, what we would be watching is whether the depreciation of the currency fits itself into a domestic price formulation. The situation gets complicated by the recent agreement by OPEC that meant that the oil price began to rise. And that means that a combination of higher oil prices, an appreciating dollar which leads to the depreciation of emerging market currencies, and food prices which are now rebounding from record lows could make for a very challenging environment for monetary policy, he said.Meanwhile Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said South Africa must remain focused on fostering inclusive economic growth, reports EWN.Citing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, he said growth may reach 1.3% in 2017, and that the year would be turbulent. I can say that [from] 2017 and onwards, we will be seeking to make sure that there is policy certainty and that when institutions of government speak, they speak with one voice; they speak from the same sheet, and that investors have the amount of certainty that they should have with regards to seeing South Africa as an environment in which they can invest, EWN quotes him as saying.Ramaphosa is leading the South African delegation at the forum, in President Jacob Zuma s absence. Both Ramaphosa and Gordhan have cited inclusive growth as a key priority for the country. Our singular purpose as a country is first to get the growth, [then] make it more inclusive, restructure our economy, get more competition going and give the black community which is still largely marginalised from the economy much more opportunities structurally to participate in the economy in a meaningful way, Gordhan told media at a pre-WEF briefing late last year.Brand SA CEO Ambassador Kingsley Makhubela, told the SAfm Market Update with Moneyweb that Team South Africa will be assuring potential investors that the country is open for business.
