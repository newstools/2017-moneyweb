At the beginning of 2016, following Nene-gate in December 2015, banks were trading at low ratings by historical standards, both on an absolute PE basis and relative to the overall market PE. Despite a strong performance in 2016, we still believe banks are not expensive on an absolute or relative basis as evident in the bank sector s PE relative to its historical level and in terms of its current relative to the market PE compared to its long-term historical average. Historically, the performance of banks compared to insurers has been closely related to changes in the SA sovereign 10-year bond yield. Using monthly data since 1995 the correlation of the bond yield to the quotient of the SA insurance index divided by the SA banks index (insurers relative to banks) is 0.92.&nbsp;There are good reasons this relationship should hold. Rising bond yields are usually associated with higher inflation, which has tended to suit insurance companies more than banks as insurers are more geared to equity markets, which have held up in inflationary environments, while inflation and rising interest rates have, relative to insurers, hampered bank growth.If one believes the relationship will continue to hold, then we find it difficult to motivate a materially overweight position in banks relative to insurers.In our view, rising US interest rates will tend to put pressure on emerging market currencies and therefore put pressure on SA inflation and interest rates. In addition, South Africa continues to live under the cloud of a debt ratings downgrade and the uncertainty around succession in the ANC, whose elective conference will take place in December 2017, may put pressure on the ZAR exchange rate and, through its impact on inflation, on interest rates.While banks continue to trade at a significant PE discount to the AllShare compared their long term average (the current PE relative is 68% of its long term average) this is even more so in the case of life insurers, whose PE relative to the AllShare is 42% of its long-term average.With this in mind, we would caution against a materially overweight position in banks versus insurers.In the insurance sector our preference is for Old Mutual and MMI over Discovery, Liberty and Sanlam.With respect to the banks, we are cautious on Barclays Africa, largely because of the potential share placement by its holding company, Barclays, and we have a slight preference for Firstrand, RMB Holdings and Nedbank over Standard Bank.
