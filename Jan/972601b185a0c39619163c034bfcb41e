HARARE &#8211; Zimbabwean farmers in the maize growing regions face a threat from the armyworm, a pest that consumes vast fields of crops if left unchecked, a government official said.Maize is the staple crop in the southern African nation, where the government has set a target of 2 million tonnes this year after a devastating drought in 2016.Godfrey Chikwenhere, the chief entomologist in the Ministry of Agriculture, said on Wednesday that the armyworm was affecting crops in eight out of Zimbabwe&#8217;s 10 provinces. The government has not yet estimated the amount of maize affected, he said.The worms become moths and their name derives from the fact that they &#8220;march&#8221; across the landscape in large groups while in the caterpillar stage, feasting on young maize plants and wiping out entire fields.&#8220;The armyworm is the biggest challenge to farmers at the moment and the government has distributed a contact pesticide to eradicate the worms,&#8221; Chikwenhere said.Chikwenhere said the armyworm could become resistant to chemicals if farmers did not correctly apply the pesticide.Zambia, Zimbabwe&#8217;s northern neighbour and major maize producer, has started a campaign aimed at stemming the armyworm, which has affected 124,000 hectares of maize in that country.
