South Africa&#8217;s The Foschini Group (TFG) posted better than expected Christmas sales, the firm said on Monday, buoyed by its recent British acquisitions and sending its shares to a 20-month high. The clothing and homeware retailer expanded in developed markets as a weak economy, tighter credit rules and tough competition hampered growth in its home market. TFG, which bought Britain&#8217;s Phase Eight in 2015 and last year added high street chain Whistles, said sales at its international division were 47.9% higher in December than a year ago. &#8220;Christmas trading was above expectation, with TFG Group sales growth for December (Nov. 27 to Dec. 24) of 14.6%,&#8221; the firm said. For the nine months to Dec. 24, total sales &#8211; which include its African and international divisions &#8211; rose 14.5%, the firm said, without disclosing the total value. Shares in TFG gained 5.29 to R168.50 at the close, its highest since May 2015, compared with a 0.69% rise in the JSE&#8217;s All-share index. TFG&#8217;s trading update is more upbeat than those of its South African competitors, who are struggling to grow sales in an economy forecast to have expanded by less than 1% in 2016. Truworths International last week flagged a drop in half-year profit as sales on in-store cards stalled due to tougher credit rules, while Woolworths Holdings also said it expects lower half-year profit.
