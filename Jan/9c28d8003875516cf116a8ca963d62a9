JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s manufacturing output rose by 1.9 percent year-on-year in November, beating market expectations, after contracting by 2.7 percent in October, Statistics South Africa said on Thursday.On a month-on-month basis, factory production rose 0.3 percent but edged down 1.1 percent in the three months to November compared with the previous three months.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.9 percent year-on-year decrease in manufacturing volumes.In a note released on Thursday, Nedbank&#8217;s Group Economic Unit said the sector is seen faring better this year, &#8220;with output rising off last year s low base as global growth accelerates moderately, international commodity prices continue to drift higher and domestic demand conditions start to improve.&#8221;It added that Thursday&#8217;s figures again confirm economic activity was still weak and &#8220;underlying confidence fragile&#8221; toward the end of last year.&#8220;The upside risks to inflation outlook have eased noticeably since all three major rating agencies affirmed the country s sovereign risk rating in early December and the rand has held up relatively well against most major currencies so far in January. These developments have reduced the chances of further monetary tightening in early 2017. Interest rates have probably peaked.&#8221;The bank unit expects that the Reserve Bank&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will remain cautious and keep interest rates at current levels for a while, due to downside risks to the rand from &#8220;a volatile domestic landscape and changing global dynamics&#8221;. It expects the MPC to start easing monetary policy in the second half of the year, &#8220;as inflation moves into the target band on a more sustainable basis.&#8221;
