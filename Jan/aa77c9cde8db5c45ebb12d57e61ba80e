JOHANNESBURG If you have recently returned to South Africa from an overseas holiday or business trip, you may have suffered from a slightly uneasy feeling when passing through customs at the airport, desperately trying to avoid eye contact with the customs official.You may have been scared that the detector dog could smell the cheese in your bag. There is also a reasonable chance you just didn t have the slightest clue what your (tax) obligations were in relation to the items you bought with those (now slightly less) expensive dollars or pounds. Before writing this article, I surely didn t.Prohibited and restricted goodsWhile the Department of Home Affairs is in charge of immigration control, the South African Revenue Service (Sars) is responsible for customs control.According to its Traveller s Guide, it is illegal to enter South Africa with prohibited goods . This includes addictive drugs, military weapons, explosives, poison, cigarettes of more than 2kg per 1 000 in weight and counterfeit items.Some items may only be imported if you have the necessary permit and should be declared at the airport. These include firearms, South African banknotes of more than R25 000, gold coins and certain medicine. Animals, plants and their products (dairy, butter, eggs, seeds, flowers, fruit, honey margarine and vegetable oil) also have to be declared.The duty-free allowanceYour duty-free allowance refers to items that can be brought into the country without paying customs duty or VAT.For the purposes of determining the duty-free allowance, Sars does not distinguish between goods bought overseas during the normal course of the holiday or business trip and items bought at the duty-free area at the airport, its spokesperson, Sandile Memela, explains. The allowance is applicable to both in total. The duty-free allowance includes consumables of up to 200 cigarettes and 20 cigars, up to 250g of cigarette or pipe tobacco, up to 50ml of perfume and 250ml eau de toilette, up to 2 litres of wine and up to 1 litre of other alcoholic beverages per person.In addition to the consumable allowance , travellers are allowed new or used goods in their hand and checked-in luggage (on the same flight) to the value of R5 000. A traveller is entitled to these allowances once per person during a period of 30 days after an absence of 48 hours from South Africa, Memela says.All other goods and gifts (excluding the duty-free allowance) bought overseas are subject to customs duty and VAT when returning to South Africa, the guide states.Individuals may choose to pay customs duty at a flat rate of 20% on items bought while travelling abroad, but the total value of these additional goods may not be more than R20 000 per person (R2 000 for crew members). Where this option is selected the goods will be exempted from VAT. If you decide not to use this option or if the value of the additional items is more than R20 000, the normal VAT and duty rates will apply to each item individually, according to the Sars website.In the example below, the taxpayer bought clothes worth R4 500 at a shop in New York City while travelling, clothes worth R2 000 at a duty-free shop at the airport as well as 50ml of perfume to the value of R1 000. Thus, the goods exceed the R5 000 allowance but fall within the flat rate threshold.Declared itemsQuantityValue in ZARCustoms ValueClothing bought in NYC10 itemsR4 500R4 500Clothing bought at duty-free shop5 itemsR2 000R2 000Perfume50mlR1 000Part of duty-free allowance (see above)Subtotal&nbsp;&nbsp;R6 500(Traveller selects to be assessed by applying the duty-free allowance and the flat rate option.)SubtotalR6 500Less duty-free allowanceR5 000&nbsp;R1 500Flat rate @20%R 300 Failure to declare goods, the under-declaration of values and the production of false receipts or invoices can lead to the seizure of your goods and can result in criminal prosecution or the imposition of severe penalties of up to three times the value of the goods, the guide states.
