South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed against the dollar on Thursday, touching a four-week high as the greenback lost ground against a basket of currencies after unimpressive US labour data.As the rand strengthened, investors sold off shares in local companies that earn the bulk of their revenues in hard currency &#8212; or rand hedge shares &#8212; amid thin trading volumes, dragging the index lower.Higher platinum and gold prices also offered support to the rand, NKC African Economics said in a note.At 1538 GMT, the rand traded at 13.5400 per dollar, 0.62% firmer than its close in New York trading on Wednesday. Earlier on Thursday it hit a four-week high of 13.4950 before easing back.&#8220;Rand hedges for the most part have weakened during the course of the day,&#8221; said Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods.Gold touched its highest level in four weeks on Thursday as the dollar weakened, while platinum was near eight-week highs.The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six world currencies, fell 1.09% to 101.580.Meanwhile, South African sovereign bonds firmed alongside the currency, and the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 dipped 6.5 basis points to 8.86%.On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index fell 0.64% to 43 682 points while the All-Share index dropped 0.56% to 50 475 points.
