Nigeria is a federation, and the regulation of the welfare of employees is one of the matters in respect of which both the federal and the state legislatures have powers to make laws. It is therefore advisable for foreign investors to take steps to familiarise themselves with, and understand, the applicable federal and state laws and regulations that protect the rights of employees in order to avoid legal risks. By familiarising themselves with the laws, foreign investors can also protect themselves from reputational risks, lawsuits and the penalties (which, in some cases, involve a term of imprisonment).Constitutional rightsThe Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Promulgation) Act, Chapter C23, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 (as amended) (the Constitution ) guarantees the fundamental human rights of individuals in Nigeria. The Constitution incorporates what it terms as Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy . These objectives include, among other things, the objective of ensuring that Nigerian citizens are afforded the opportunity to find suitable employment without discrimination and to work under just and humane conditions with access to equal pay for work.The Constitution also prescribes policies in relation to safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of employees and protecting children against exploitation. It also prohibits a person from being held in slavery or servitude or performing forced or compulsory labour. The provisions of Chapter 2 (sections 13 to 24) of the Constitution have been held to be non-justiciable unless such provision is made the subject of an enactment passed into law by the legislative houses of a state or that of the federal government.It is against this backdrop that the Lagos State Government passed the Lagos State Special Peoples Law 2011 (the Special Peoples Law ), which has only just become operational. The law establishes an office that is responsible for protecting people living with disabilities against all forms of discrimination and for ensuring equality in their opportunities in all aspects of living within the society. The Law also prohibits employers from discriminating against persons with disabilities, prohibits employers from terminating the contracts of employees that sustain disabilities during the course of the employment, and imposes significant monetary obligations on employers in respect of employees that die or sustain disabling injuries that make them unable to work.The compensation payable under the Special Peoples Law appears to be in addition to the obligations imposed on employers under the Employees Compensation Act 2010 (a federal law), which provides for the payment of compensation to employees who suffer occupational diseases or sustain injuries from accidents in the workplace or in the course of employment.Given that the Employees Compensation Act, which is a federal law, contains comprehensive provisions on the treatment of employees that sustain injury in the course of work, it is unlikely that the provisions of the Special Peoples Law can be successfully enforced against an employer. This is because the Nigerian courts have held that where a federal statute already covers the field (i.e. comprehensively deals with a particular subject in an area where a state also has the power to make law), it will take precedence over a state law.Under the Labour Act, employers are also obliged to conduct medical examinations on their employees at their expense, but this right is circumscribed by the provisions of the HIV and AIDS (Anti-Discrimination) Act 2014 (a federal law) and the Lagos State Persons Living with HIV/AIDS Law 2007 which seek to protect the rights and dignity of employees or prospective employees living with HIV/AIDS.The National Industrial CourtThe National Industrial Court (the NIC ) was established in 1976, and has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of all civil matters and actions that cover labour and employment matters. Appeals from the judgments of the Court only lie to the Court of Appeal in very limited circumstances. In arriving at its decision, the NIC is obliged to have recourse to good and international best practices in labour and industrial relations, and what constitutes best practices in labour and industrial relations is a matter of fact.In addition, although the court is required to apply the rules of law and equity concurrently in matters brought before the court, where there is a conflict between the law and equity, the principles of equity would prevail. This is however, subject to the express provisions of any existing law.With the benefit of the expanded powers granted by the National Industrial Court Act, 2006 and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Third Alteration) Act, 2010, the NIC has significantly changed the position of the law with respect to the reinstatement of employees whose employments have been terminated. Prior to the decisions of the NIC, the remedy of reinstatement was only available to employees whose contracts of employment had a statutory flavour &#8211; i.e. public servants whose employments are regulated by statute.The NIC has now ruled, however, that the remedy is also available to employees in the private sector and that it will be prepared to order the reinstatement of employees whose appointments have been terminated as a result, for instance, of such employee s involvement in trade union activities or where the employer did not obtain an approval required by, or comply with requirements prescribed in, an employee s contract of employment.Guidelines for employees in the oil and gas industryUnder Nigerian labour law, the general principle is that an employer may terminate an employee s employment provided the employer complies with the terms and conditions of such employee s contract. The Guidelines on the Procedures for the Release of Staff in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry (the Guidelines ) issued by the Department of Petroleum Resources (the DPR ) require, however, that employers in the oil and gas industry must obtain the prior consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources (the Minister ) before releasing of any Nigerian employee in their service.The term release is defined in the Guidelines to include dismissal, retirement (whether voluntary or forced), termination, redundancy, release on medical grounds, resignation, death and abandonment of duty post. The Guidelines appear, therefore, to have modified the status of Nigerians employed in the oil and gas industry to that of a protected class of employees.Employers that fail to obtain the Minister s consent prior to releasing employees could be liable to a penalty of NGN10m (ten million Naira) (approximately $32,786.89 at an exchange rate of NGN305.00 to $1.00), and could be required by the DPR to reinstate the employee until such time as the DPR reaches a decision on the proposed termination of the employee s contract. The DPR also has the power to suspend or cancel of any licences, leases, permits or approvals that is has issued to the employer.The Guidelines have not been the subject of judicial interpretation and, pending such interpretation or amendment of the Guidelines, the employment status of Nigerian nationals employed in the Nigerian oil and gas industry seem to have been elevated to something of a hybrid between a purely contractual relationship, where an employer may terminate the contract at will, and a contract protected by statute.Trade unionsIt is important for investors to note that an employer in the private sector cannot prohibit its employees from joining trade unions that are registered with the Trade Unions Registrar as prescribed by the Trade Union (Amendment) Act Chapter T14 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2005. This is because the right of employees to join trade unions is guaranteed by the Constitution.Registered trade unions are authorised to negotiate terms and conditions of employment on behalf of members, and any agreement reached is reflected in a Collective Bargaining Agreement (the CBA ), the terms of which are binding on an employer upon execution. A registered trade union or unionised employees are permitted to picket an employer s premises, provided such picketing is peaceful; and embark on strikes, provided that such strikes are not in contravention of any CBA between the trade union and the employer and the strike does not fall within the category of strikes prohibited under the Trade Unions Act.Strikes are quite common in the public sector and in the private sector, and in the oil and gas sector, food and beverages sector and manufacturing industries, where employees are more often than not members of trade unions, strikes and other forms of industrial actions are not uncommon. Trade unions have also been known to declare trade dispute with employers, which process is not only expensive (as the employer has to engage the services of legal and human resources consultants) but is also time consuming.Notwithstanding the foregoing, employers or investors in the private sector would generally have little cause to worry about trade union activities by their employees, so long as they pay decent wages, strive to maintain fair work conditions, desist from unfair labour practices and encourage dialogue and joint consultation with the trade unions, with a view to facilitating cooperation and harmonious labour relations.Ekemezie is a senior associate at Udo Udoma &amp; Belo-Osagie (Nigeria), a firm working closely with pan-African law firm, Bowmans.
