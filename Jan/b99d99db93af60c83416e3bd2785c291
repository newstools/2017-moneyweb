CAPE TOWN &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Post Office Group plans to register its financial services unit as a bank by July 3, a document handed out in parliament showed, a move that would put the company in the middle of a fiercely competitive market.The restructuring of Postbank is part of the government strategy to provide a wider range of accessible, relevant and affordable financial services products to those without bank accounts and low-income earners.But it also leads the organisation down a highly competitive path dominated by five established banks: Barclays Africa, Standard Bank, Nedbank, FirstRand and Capitec.Chief executive Mark Barnes is pinning his hopes on the state-owned company&#8217;s network of 2 500 branches that gives it a presence in almost every town and city in the country.Postbank has R1.4 billion ($104 million) in excess capital, enough to meet regulatory minimum requirements for a bank, the document showed.Barnes, who was appointed in 2015, told lawmakers the company&#8217;s ability to reach the remotest areas also puts it an ideal position to start distributing government welfare grants.&#8220;We have the best footprint, we have the most points of presence and have some experience in that (social grant disbursements),&#8221; he said.($1 = R13.5060)
