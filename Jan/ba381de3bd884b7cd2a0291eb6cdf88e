JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African fast-food chain Nando&#8217;s, best known for its hot and spicy chicken meals, denied on Tuesday speculation it was considering a stock market flotation.Citing unidentified sources, Bloomberg reported on Monday that Nando&#8217;s was weighing an initial public offering (IPO), possibly in London, to raise money for expansion.&#8220;The speculation about a Nando&#8217;s IPO is incorrect, nor are they currently considering fundraising,&#8221; the company said in a statement.&#8220;Nando&#8217;s is a privately owned business that still owned by the entrepreneurs who set up the business in the first place.&#8221;Founded in Johannesburg by friends Fernando Duarte and Robert Brozin, Nando&#8217;s has transformed itself from start up in 1987 to a multinational brand with more than 1 000 branches in 35 countries that include the United Kingdom, India and the United States.An IPO would have marked a return to the stock market after the company delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange following a buyout led by management, including Brozin and Duarte.&nbsp;
