Sibanye indicated on Thursday that it had served a Section 189 notice at its platinum operations which might result in the loss of 330 jobs. The recently acquired platinum operations comprise the Rustenburg mines bought from Anglo American Platinum and the Kroondal mine it inherited when it bought Aquarius Platinum. This &#8220;remains well within the scope of the Competition Tribunal&#8217;s ruling&#8221; when it approved the acquisitions of the two operations in March last year. &#8220;They allowed for up to 510 job losses, because we are merging three companies so there was obvious overlap. We have had some attrition so that has lowered the number. So this is not a final number, but we start from this base in our consultations with the unions and other stakeholders,&#8221; says company spokesperson James Wellsted. &nbsp;
