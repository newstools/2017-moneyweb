Dr Adrian Saville is arguably one of the brightest minds in South African investment circles and we agree with his recent comments on Moneyweb around asset allocation to South Africa.He argued that if you were sitting on Mars and looked at the global investment universe then: Anything more than 1% allocated to South Africa would be an overweight South Africa position. This is not a call on South Africa as an economy or even our geopolitical make-up, it is simply a case of weighing up risk-weighted returns over the long-run.To illustrate this point, we would like to talk about dividends.If you look at general equity investing over the last 50 years, dividends have contributed more than 50% of investment returns in developed markets. Yet many investors and investment products forget about their long-term compounding effect.Yet in South Africa we have limited options in the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) space for investing in high dividend yielding investments. We believe that there have been limited opportunities in this space because dividend investing has not been popular with stellar capital appreciation over the past 20 years and the outperformance of the listed property sector being a proxy for dividend investing. This is likely to change as the investment returns become more muted.Locally, the most popular is probably the Satrix Divi ETF which has struggled with the fallout from the likes of African Bank (Abil), which was one of its largest constituents. Over the past 12 months, the ETF has performed very well with a return of 24% but over a 3 year period, this drops down to 2.59% according to the latest fund fact sheet.Using Bloomberg, we decided to map Satrix Divi against the highly popular iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) to illustrate our point. Satrix Divi is the orange line on the graph while HDV is the blue line.&nbsp;In this second graph, we have inserted the more recently listed Coreshares DivTrx product which has a significantly shorter trading history:&nbsp;There is no question which is the better performer.Let s take it one step further and come back to the issue of risk and reward, by looking at the constituents of the two products.&nbsp;Satrix Divi% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iShares Core High Dividend%Truworths5.20Exxon Mobil7.83Barclays Group Africa5.02AT&amp;T7.82MMI Holdings4.49Verizon6.28Liberty Holdings4.8Johnson &amp; Johnson5.86MTN4.41Chevron5.39Vodacom4.20Pfizer4.84Nedbank4.17Procter &amp; Gamble4.72Foschini3.95Phlip Morris4.41FirstRand / RMBH3.87Coca-Cola3.54Standard Bank3.66Cisco Systems3.42&nbsp;Satrix Divi has 30 constituents in its basket and a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.39% while HDV holds 75 different components and a TER of 0,08% .As an asset manager, our primary goal is to preserve client capital and if we look at the composition of the two products, it is clear that Satrix Divi is highly skewed toward banks and high-end retailers. With the prospect of a downgrade still on the cards and December sales updates from SA retailers painting a bleak picture of the SA consumer, we feel capital is better protected using one of the global ETF products available to investors.In conclusion: The majority of South African retirement annuities and savings products are heavily weighted toward domestic equities. If we assume that dividends will contribute more than 50% of your annual returns between now and your retirement, then we believe that retail investors need to look beyond South Africa for superior returns.Iwan Swiegers and Steinman de Bruyn are with Capilis Asset Managers
