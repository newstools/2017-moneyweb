A private gauge indicates that India s manufacturing sector will shrink for the first time in a year as Prime Minister Narendra Modi s unprecedented clampdown on cash hurts demand.The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was at 49.6 in December, a report showed on Monday, the lowest since December 2015. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.&#8220;Shortages of money in the economy steered output and new orders in the wrong direction, thereby interrupting a continuous sequence of growth that had been seen throughout 2016,&#8221; economist Pollyanna De Lima wrote in the report. &#8220;Cash flow issues among firms also led to reductions in purchasing activity and employment.&#8221;A continued slowdown will strip India of its position as one of the world s fastest-growing big economies and risk a political backlash against Modi. PMI data is due from India s key services sector on Wednesday before focus shifts to the government s first official growth estimate for the year through March.New work and production fell slightly but recorded the first decrease in a year Payrolls decreased marginally; vast majority of panelists signaled unchanged workforces Input cost inflation accelerated &#8220;January data will be key in showing whether the sector will see a quick rebound,&#8221; De Lima said.Other recent data also mirror the stress. Motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto Ltd. s total sales slipped 22 percent in December, the steepest fall in at least 21 months. Motorcycle sales &#8212; a key indicator of rural demand &#8212; declined 18 percent. India s biggest automaker by volume, Maruti Suzuki Ltd., reported a 4.4 percent drop in domestic December sales, the first decline in six months, while overall sales fell 1 percent from a year earlier.India s economy will grow 6.9 percent in the year through March, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey published late last month. That s slower than the 7.3 percent predicted by a survey in November and the previous year s 7.6 percent actual expansion. 2017 Bloomberg L.P
