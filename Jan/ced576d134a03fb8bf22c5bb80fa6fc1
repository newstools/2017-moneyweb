The surprising strength of the oil market is the main reason why OPEC could end output cuts by the middle of the year, Saudi Arabia s energy minister said.OPEC and Russia may not need to extend the curbs when they expire in June, Khalid Al-Falih said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, characterising his view as a bullish sign. The market is re-balancing as demand proves unexpectedly robust and OPEC s Gulf members and Russia cut supply by more than they promised, he said.Twenty-four oil-producing nations, led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, agreed Dec. 10 to reduce output collectively to end a three-year crude surplus that s weighed on prices.Brent traded 0.4 percent higher at $55.70 a barrel at 7:34 a.m. London time. That s up 20 percent since OPEC s Nov. 30 agreement to cut output, yet still about 50 percent below prices in June 2014.OPEC initially suggested it could extend the six-month deal beyond June, yet Al-Falih said Monday there may be no need. He said Saudi Arabia has already brought output below 10 million barrels a day &#8212; the lowest in almost two years &#8212; while Russia is ahead of schedule in implementing production cuts. The oil market is moving in the right direction, Al-Falih said Tuesday, predicting global demand growth close to 1.5 million barrels a day this year. 2017 Bloomberg L.P
