South Africa has a fantastic opportunity, through the department of energy s upcoming gas-to-power programme, to transform its power system into one of the most sustainable; reliable; and cost effective energy systems globally, says Wayne Glossop, business development manager, W rtsil Energy Solutions.He however cautions that plans for new gas generation in the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2016 Base Case should be expedited. W rtsil is a Nasdaq listed Finish corporation that has developed Sasol s 180MW gas-fired power station at Secunda that came onto production in 2013, utilizing gas from Mozambique s Temane gas field.According to Glossop the flexibility of gas generation would support renewable energy and enable South Africa to make te most of its abundance of wind and solar resources.Internal combustion engines like those at Sasol s Secunda power plant can be ramped up and down as supply from renewable sources vary according to the availability of sunshine and wind. In fact, a gas-fired plant could accommodate variances of up to 500MW within ten minutes, without compromising the condition of the plant, Glossop says.By 2020 the country s energy mix would consist of more than 10% renewables as the department of energy s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer s Program (REIPPP) matures. At the same time Eskom s coal-fired fleet would start to reach the end of its lifespan.That would increase the need for flexible technology to support the renewables and ageing coal fleet, he says. Glossop says the strong renewable/gas mix provided for in the IRP 2016 Base Case assumptions at load factors of 27% and 36% indicate an appreciation for the role of gas as combined peaking and renewable balancing technology. The fact that the IRP only specifies new gas to come online by 2024 is concerning considering that there will be an 11,03% renewable energy penetration by that time and for sure, there would be additional flexible capacity required , he says.He says including new ultra-flexible gas capacity in the system by 2020 would create more savings than if there were no gas at all.
