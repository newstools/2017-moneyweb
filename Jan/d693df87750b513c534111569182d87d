JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s headline consumer inflation accelerated to 6.8 percent year-on-year in December, beating market expectations, from 6.6 percent in November, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 6.5 percent year-on-year inflation print.On a month-on-month basis, inflation quickened to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent previously.Core inflation, which excludes the prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, petrol and energy, rose to 5.9 percent year-on-year in December from 5.7 percent and edged higher to 0.5 percent on a month-on-month basis from 0.1 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;South African Reserve Bank&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next week to decide on interest rates. In a report released after the CPI data, FNB household and property sector strategist John Loos said SA&#8217;s CPI acceleration could be &#8220;interesting&#8221;, as it is still above the upper inflation target limit of 6%.&#8221; However, FNB sees the MPC keeping interest rates unchanged, as Sarb is expected to be &#8220;foreseeing a significant slowing in food price inflation as merely a &#8216;matter of time'&#8221;, owing to reports that drought conditions have improved somewhat.Loos adds that the producer price inflation rate for agriculture has slowed sharply (20.6% year-on-year in June to 6.9% by November 2016), which points to food price inflation slowing. &#8220;Slowing food price inflation can return the CPI inflation rate to the 3-6% target range in the near term,&#8221; he says.&#8220;In addition, the rand has behaved reasonably well in recent times, with the trade-weighted exchange rate index having strengthened by 23% year-on-year in January to date. This could significantly curb broad imported consumer price inflation in the near term.&#8221;However, until food price inflation subsides, the key concern should be the wide differential between the inflation rates of low income groups and those of higher income groups: low income groups experience significantly higher CPI inflation rates.&#8220;This is largely the result of food s far higher weighting in the lower income groups expenditure baskets. So, &#8216;Expenditure Quintile 1&#8217;, the lowest expenditure quintile (a good proxy for lowest income group) had the highest CPI inflation rate of 8.36%, while Expenditure Quintile 5, the highest expenditure group still had the lowest inflation rate of 6.58% as at December.&#8221;&nbsp;
