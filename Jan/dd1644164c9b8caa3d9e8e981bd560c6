The Guptas have come out swinging against finance minister Pravin Gordhan s affidavit in which he requested the courts to affirm his decision not to intervene in the decision made by the countries big four banks to close the accounts of Oakbay Investments.In a press release announcing the filing of its reply in the Pretoria High Court on Friday, Oakbay says the minister s application is superfluous and riddled with factual and legal errors. It also bizarrely states they never suggested that the minister should intervene in the bank-customer relationship &#8211; despite their writing numerous letters to Gordhan to ask him to do precisely that. There is no contested legal issue here and there is never any reason for the minister to bring this application, says the company, adding that The minister has essentially asked the court to insert itself into the functioning of the executive branch. The press release also hints at a political conspiracy as the basis for the minister s affidavit, saying, This application is an abuse of court and an effort to involve the independent judiciary to settle political scores. No mention is made of who or what is behind the conspiracy led by Gordhan that aims to &#8220;clip the wings&#8221; of the family and their business aspirations in the country.The company also distances itself from the 72 suspicious transactions the minister cited in his affidavit, which was sourced from the Financial Intelligence Centre. Oakbay evidently commissioned Nardello &amp; Co, a US-based investigative firm to look into the matter, and says it concluded that there is not adequate evidence to even connect the transactions with the Oakbay Group.
