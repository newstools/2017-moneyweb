JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand paused a recent rally on Thursday, edging weaker in early trade as some investors pocketed profits amid a retreat in commodity prices that have until now buoyed emerging market currencies.The rand slipped to 0.13% to 13.2400 per dollar at 0650 GMT, slightly off its firmest in 2-1/2 months but still poised to test resistance around 13.20 on the greenback&#8217;s slide.The unit is up more than 3% vs dollar so far this week, outpacing most emerging market rivals as the central bank&#8217;s decision on Tuesday to keep lending rates at 7% spurred momentum.Forward markets are pricing in a 25% chance of a 25 bps points hike in March after Sarb Governor Lesetja Kganyago poured water on chances of a cut.Stocks are set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index up 0.7%.Bonds are slightly firmer, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 1.5 basis points at 8.735%.Producer price inflation data is due at 0930 GMT.
