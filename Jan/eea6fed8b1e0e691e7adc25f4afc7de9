Bill Gross is right. The 2.6 percent level on 10-year Treasuries is much more important than Dow 20,000.How many more times must we write antiquated , anachronism or relic in reminders that the oldest index in the world is price-weighted? As Bloomberg Intelligence s Eric Balchunas puts it, the gauge was designed before aspirin was invented.Here are three ways that show how the Dow s price-weighting methodology makes a difference.1. Where do the points come from? The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed about 15 percent, or 2,530 points, since the end of 2015. Its four best performers, all rising a similar amount, added about 1,000 points between them. But look at the distribution of those points. A 32 percent gain in $312 billion JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. was only good enough for 140 points, while $103 billion rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. contributed 437 points with a 36 percent increase. The best performer in the index, Caterpillar Inc., rose 39 percent and contributed 178 points, despite having a market capitalization of $55 billion. Size doesn t matter in the Dow.2. Price versus market cap weightings in action A price-weighted index is a function of the share prices of its members, a market-capitalization index is a function of their market value. And as Bloomberg View s Matt Levine reminds us, Calculating a price-weighted average of a small arbitrary group of stocks is no way to go through life. Under these different methodologies, an index with the same members, even over a short enough time frame, will clearly show different results.3. Want to get the Dow above 20,000? Time for an experiment. Let s take Cisco Systems Inc., which as of Wednesday had a market capitalization of about $150 billion and the lowest stock price in the Dow, and see what happens when it s replaced. Here s what the Dow would look like when a selection of worthy constituents &#8212; Campbell Soup Co. (founded in 1869, worth about $18 billion as of Wednesday), Emerson Electric Co. (1890, $37 billion) or even Harley-Davidson Inc. (1903, $10 billion) &#8212; are added. 20,000! Just don t replace it with $76 billion Priceline Group Inc., it will take all the fun out of Dow 30,000. 2017 Bloomberg L.P
