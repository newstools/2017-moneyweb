Select certain Group B expenses you wish to reduce or stop [that gym subscription?), do so and allocate extra payments to shorten the outstanding payment periods (and reduce the interest payable) of Group A expenses or start a small rainy day account for those unexpected financial surprises. Which expenses should be reduced and in what order of priority will depend upon circumstances such as interest rates, tax deductibility, outstanding payment periods and so on. Always a good idea to consult a professional to assist you in making the correct decision.Take the information from your HR Department and your last tax assessment to your financial advisor and ask him to make proposals concerning your retirement annuity investment and/or any possible topping up of your pension or provident fund investment. Be very careful to assess the cash flow impact of any decision you make to increase contributions.&nbsp;Thayn Niemand is a financial planner at Verso Wealth
