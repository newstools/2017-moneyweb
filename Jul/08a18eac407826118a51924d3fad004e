Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.PMI dayGlobal Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index Day kicked off in China overnight, where the Caixin Media and Markit Economics gauge rose to 50.4 in June, showing a return to expansion after contracting in May. Euro-area manufacturing expanded at the strongest pace in over six years with IHS Markit&#8217;s PMI climbing to 57.4, as data for Greece showed an expansion for the first time since last August. In the UK there were signs that uncertainty is hitting demand, as the reading fell more than expected to a three-month low of 54.3, down from 56.3 in May. Markit&#8217;s US manufacturing data is due at 9:45am Eastern Time. Qatari consoleQatar is set to deliver its official response to the 13 demands made by the Saudi-led coalition of Gulf states which have cut diplomatic and transport links with the country, even as the US and Kuwait step up diplomatic efforts to resolve the month-long crisis. Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who said on Sunday that his country is ready to face the consequences of not acceding to the demands, has landed in Kuwait to deliver his government&#8217;s answer, according to Doha-based Al Jazeera. Doha&#8217;s QE Index dropped as much as 4% yesterday, in the first trading session after a week-long holiday. Oil riseA barrel of West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was trading at $46.14 as of 5:33am after US production showed signs of slowing, with the Baker Hughes rig count dropping for the first time in 24 weeks on Friday. Production in Libya, which is exempt from the Opec-led output deal, surpassed one million barrels a day for the first time since June 2013, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
