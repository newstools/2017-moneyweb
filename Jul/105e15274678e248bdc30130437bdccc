Wall Street was little changed on Wednesday as gains in technology stocks were overshadowed by steep losses in energy shares, while investors awaited minutes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s last meeting for more clues on interest rate hikes this year.The Fed, which lifted interest rates and unveiled details of its plan to cut its mammoth crisis-era bond portfolio at its mid-June meeting, will release minutes at 2pm ET (1800 GMT).A recent set of tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the central bank&#8217;s 2% target may have a bearing on its rate hike plans.&#8220;Markets will also be paying very close attention to see if the minutes suggest that the recent fall in inflation is &#8216;transitory&#8217;, with suggestions of higher rates still on the cards, unless the US economy decelerates,&#8221; said Lukman Otunuga, analyst with FXTM Research.US factory goods orders are likely to drop 0.5% in May, compared with a 0.2% decline in April.
