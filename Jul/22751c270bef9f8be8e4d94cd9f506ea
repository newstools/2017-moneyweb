Tencent can&#8217;t outplay Beijing&#8217;s fun police. On Tuesday, investors wiped out $14 billion from the tech giant&#8217;s market value after China&#8217;s official government newspaper criticised &#8220;Honour of Kings&#8221;, its lucrative but addictive mobile hit. Tencent is moving to placate Beijing by limiting game time for kids. But if regulators crack down further on popular titles, appeasing them could prove costly.In a harsh two-part editorial series, the People&#8217;s Daily lambasted the company&#8217;s blockbuster fantasy role-playing title, which boasts more than 200 million users and is the world&#8217;s top-grossing mobile game, according to App Annie. The Communist Party mouthpiece called it &#8220;poison&#8221;, citing examples of children stealing to pay for in-game items and suffering strokes as a result of being addicted to the game.On Sunday, a day before the first editorial was published, the company proactively announced new rules for &#8220;Honour of Kings&#8221;, including limiting those under 12 years old to one hour of game time a day, plus restrictions on how much younger users can spend on the game. This is an affordable bit of self-discipline for the $327 billion social media and gaming group. Analysts at China Merchant Securities estimate the new measures on &#8220;Honour of Kings&#8221; will, in the worst case, affect less than 3% of Tencent&#8217;s forecast total revenue of 224 billion yuan ($33 billion) for this year.The bigger risk is if regulators launch a wider, more heavy-handed crackdown on its other online titles, which together accounted for 46% of total sales at Tencent in the three months to March. The second People&#8217;s Daily editorial called for strengthened supervision and oversight of the industry, adding to investor worries and helping shave 4% off the share price on Tuesday. Shares in Tencent are still up 42% since the start of the year. But even China&#8217;s tech champions will struggle to protect themselves against unpredictable bureaucrats.Context news&#8211; On July 4 China&#8217;s official government newspaper the People&#8217;s Daily published the second house editorial in a two-part series criticising the popular mobile game &#8220;Honour of Kings&#8221;, owned by gaming group Tencent. The second article called for strengthened regulation of online games to prevent addiction. The first article, published on July 3, accused the game of being &#8220;poison&#8221; and harmful to children.&#8211; Tencent&#8217;s Hong Kong-listed shares closed down 4.% to HK$269.2 on July 4, the largest single day drop since February 2016.&#8211; On July 2 Tencent said on its official microblog that it will limit play time for some young users on &#8220;Honour of Kings&#8221; and ban users under 12 from logging in after 2100. The company also said it will impose restrictions on how much money younger users can spend on the game, Reuters reported.The fantasy role-playing game based on Chinese historical characters is the world&#8217;s top-grossing game in terms of worldwide iOS and Google Play revenue in May, according to mobile data intelligence firm App Annie&#8217;s latest monthly index. It grossed on average $84 million per month on iOS in China in the first five months of the year, App Annie data showed.This author is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.
