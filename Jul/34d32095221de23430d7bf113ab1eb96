JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African explosives and chemicals company AECI is working on a number of acquisitions at home and abroad after building up a war chest of R6 billion, CEO Mark Dytor said on Wednesday.South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s second biggest economy, slid into recession for the first time since 2009 in March and Dytor said the shrinking manufacturing base at home was partly behind the company&#8217;s search for more targets abroad.&#8220;We are working on a few acquisition opportunities right now. There are some still local but there is also outside South Africa that we are looking at,&#8221; Dytor told Reuters. &#8220;We are well down the line with three or four at the moment.&#8221;&#8220;We have got quite a war chest that we can go buy companies with,&#8221; he said, adding that the company might also go to the market to raise more cash to fund acquisitions.AECI, which has a presence in Africa, Australia, Indonesia and South America, will look for further acquisitions in Europe, Africa and North America in the agricultural sector, industrial chemicals and construction, Dytor said.&#8220;We have to be a little smarter in where we go and invest and acquire companies and in what sectors,&#8221; Dytor said, adding that the state of the South African economy meant there was not enough volume at home for the company.Besides its speciality chemicals division, the company supplies explosives to mining companies across Africa and in other mining centres around the world.Business confidence has dropped after Moody&#8217;s lowered South Africa&#8217;s rating to the bottom of the investment grade table, citing a cabinet reshuffle and reduced growth prospects. S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch rate South Africa as &#8220;junk&#8221;.AECI said earlier on Wednesday that sales at its speciality chemicals division, which accounts for more than half its revenue, declined 1.5% to R4.9 billion in the first six months of the year.Rival South African chemicals maker Omnia Holdings said last month it will look at acquisitions and expand into other African countries to try to boost its fortunes.
