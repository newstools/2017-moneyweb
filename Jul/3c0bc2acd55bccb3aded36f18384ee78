Vukile Property Fund has acquired a property portfolio of retail parks in Spain for 193 million (R2.9 billion) via its subsidiary Castellana Properties, making it a substantial investor in the Spanish real estate market on the JSE.This is the first Spanish real estate deal for Vukile since it acquired an 87% stake in Castellana in May.The acquisition of the nine retail parks boosts Vukile s offshore exposure from 14% to 21% of total property assets worth R18.7 billion, and grows the number of properties in Castellana s portfolio from two to 11.Vukile, with a market capitalisation of R12.8 billion, now offers investors exposure to Spain on the JSE without them physically taking their rands offshore.Other JSE-listed real estate companies that are exposed to Spain (comprising a small portion of their property portfolios) include Schroder European Real Estate Investment Trust, Greenbay Properties and Intu Properties.At work to fund the deal is Vukile s R1.5 billion war chest of existing cash and debt facilities of about 58.2 million (R874 million). To supplement the remainder of the deal s purchase price, Castellana has secured debt funding of 94.8 million at a 1.98% cost of debt. The acquisition yield on the properties is a pre-geared 6.2%.The lack of quality deals in SA has prompted Vukile to diversify into Western Europe for growth opportunities, said CEO Laurence Rapp.Property companies have been allured by the low cost of debt and high yields on properties in Europe, boosting dividend payouts in year one. While in SA, the cost of debt is typically higher than yields on properties.The Spanish economy has shown signs of recovery in recent years after falling into a recession from the 2007/8 global credit crisis. The International Monetary Fund expects Spain s economy to grow by 2.6% in 2017 on the back of consumer consumption, higher employment levels and a growing tourism industry.However, rental growth on properties is still below pre-credit crisis levels.Rapp said the acquired retail parks can grow their monthly rental rate per square metre of 9 to the level charged by prime retail parks of 10 to 12 due to the rise of ecommerce, which is still nascent in Spain. Our retail parks will benefit from the rise of e-commerce and the click-and-collect model, which is popular with consumers in light of rising home delivery costs, he said.The portfolio of retail parks, occupied by electronics retailer MediaMarkt, hardware retailer Aki, Steinhoff s Conforama and others, has a weighted average lease expiry profile of 15.6 years and a vacancy rate of 2.7%.Meago Asset Managers director Jay Padayatchi said Vukile s entry into Spain is exciting as Spain s economic fundamentals appear to be more attractive than the UK. While the acquisition yield appears to be in line with market yields, the location and size of assets and consumer shopping patterns require further interrogation, he said. Another anomaly is that the tenant base is significantly exposed to electronics making up 25% of the rental base, a category that is usually negatively impacted early on by ecommerce growth. Padayatchi added that the Vukile management seems to be able to extract growth in offshore markets, which will include the combination of organic growth, redevelopment opportunities and further acquisitions. Castellana has the capacity to grow the value of its property portfolio up to 1 billion (R15 billion) in the next few years , said Rapp. Vukile would be central to funding the deals via debt, as its conservative gearing of 31% can be raised up to 40%.Ian Anderson, chief investment officer of Bridge Fund Managers, said the Spanish transaction should go a long way to keeping shareholders happy and creating a solid platform for the future .Vukile s stock trades at one-year forward yield in excess of 9%, which Anderson said doesn t fully reflect the company s improved portfolio and prospects.&nbsp; Five years ago, management laid out their strategy to create a more focused company and this transaction goes a long way to completing that strategic vision, said Anderson.
