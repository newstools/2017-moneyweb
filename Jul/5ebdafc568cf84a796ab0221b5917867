Kenya started selling another 1 billion shillings ($9.64 million) worth of bonds via mobile phone on Friday after an initial 150 million shillings issued sold out in days.The East African nation started selling a three-year infrastructure bond, called M-Akiba, on March 23, becoming the first country in the world to issue a mobile phone-based bond without any need for a bank account.&#8220;Today we again celebrate our leadership in mobile money innovation,&#8221; Kenya&#8217;s finance minister Henry Rotich said during an event to launch the bond at the Nairobi Securities Exchange.The initial 150 million shillings raised was the first tranche of the bond.Friday&#8217;s offering left another 3.85 billion shillings to be sold at a later date. The bond sale is a further advance in financial technology for the country which pioneered mobile money with M-Pesa in 2007.Kenya has borrowed intensively in the past four years to fund an ambitious development programme, including new roads and a coast-capital railway, and the government wants to raise more cash.However, few ordinary Kenyans bought government bonds, scared off by the minimum investment of 50 000 shillings and the need for a commercial bank account.M-Akiba allows a single investor to put in a minimum of 3 000 shillings and a maximum 1 million shillings, earning tax-free interest of 10%. They will be able to trade them on the secondary market. The bond was initially available on telecom companies&#8217; money transfer services, but has since also been opened to a similar operation run by commercial banks, known as Pesalink.The bond will be on sale from June 30-July 21 and will be tradable on the stock exchange on July 25.Rotich said that in future all infrastructure bonds offered by the government will have a portion of them dedicated for sale via mobile phone.
