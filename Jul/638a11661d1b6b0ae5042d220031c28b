It ll take more than central bank tightening to shake volatility from its yearlong slumber, according to Goldman Sachs Group. A large shock such as recession or war is usually required.That s generally been the case for the 14 similar low volatility regimes since 1928, at least in equity markets, Goldman Sachs strategists Christian Mueller-Glissmann and Alessio Rizzi said. These periods on average lasted nearly two years, featured short-lived spikes and realised S&amp;P 500 volatility was usually at or below 10.Swings picked up across assets in the past week and investors are positioning for a shift higher, in part because of fears of central bank tightening, the strategists wrote in a July 3 report. But a sustained breakout is unlikely without an escalation in uncertainty or recession risk, they said. &nbsp;Source: Bloomberg&nbsp; Volatility spikes have been hard to predict as they often occur after unpredictable major geopolitical events, such as wars and terror attacks, or adverse economic or financial shocks and so-called &#8220;unknown unknowns&#8221; (e.g. Black Monday in 1987), London-based Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi said. Recessions and a slowing business cycle have historically resulted in a high vol regime across assets. Goldman Sachs puts the chances of a recession in the next two years at 25%.Low volatility isn t unusual and tends to stem from a favorable macroeconomic backdrop with strong growth but anchored inflation and rates, similar to a Goldilocks scenario, Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi said. Markets have reflected this since January, with equities reaching record highs, strong global growth and declining bond yields, they said.The risk investors face near-term is a consolidation but no transition to sustained high volatility, and to guard against this, Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi recommend protection through put spreads.
