Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.G-19 plus 1President Donald Trump&#8217;s disdain for the status quo on world trade is likely to be one of the main flashpoints at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Also on the rader is North Korea and its recent missile launch, with Trump, who&#8217;s in Poland this morning, saying that the US is considering &#8220;pretty severe things&#8221; to retaliate. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to put the onus back on the US to find a solution to the Korean problem when he meets Trump on the sidelines of the Hamburg summit. Brexit frictionEuropean Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier this morning laid out the difficulties the UK will face in retaining access to the single market if it goes ahead with a so-called &#8216;hard Brexit,&#8217; including the end of Britain&#8217;s frictionless trade with the currency bloc. Deutsche Bank is not waiting for the results of the Brexit negotiations to make its mind up about the UK as the lender is preparing to move large parts of its trading and investment-banking assets it currently books in London to its hometown of Frankfurt, according to people familiar with the matter. There was some good news for the City of London as Barclays Plc chairman John McFarlane said he is confident euro-clearing business would remain in the UK. ECB minutesYesterday&#8217;s Federal Reserve meeting minutes revealed a split among policymakers on the timing of balance-sheet normalisation, while suggesting the bank plans to maintain gradual rate hikes. Today it is the ECB&#8217;s turn as it publishes its account of discussions at its last policy decision. There is little new that is expected as there has already been a raft of comments from the region&#8217;s central bankers since that meeting. At 12:00pm Eastern Time European Central Bank Governing Council members Jens Weidmann and Ewald Nowotny will also discuss the future of the euro in Austria.
