A story about Steve.Warren, it strikes me that if you did nothing else you never sell. That is, if you can grit your teeth through and just disregard short-term declines in the market or even long-term declines in the market, you will come out well. I mean you just stick all your money in stocks and go home and don t look at your portfolio you ll do far better than if you try to trade it. Alan GreenspanIt was in a discussion in 2014 between the ex-governor of the Federal Reserve and Warren Buffett that Alan Greenspan uttered this profound statement. So let s see how this affects our friend Steve.Steve is South Africa s worst market timer, and like so many other investors it took him a long time to build up enough trust to invest his hard-earned savings. What follows is the tale of Steve s terrible market timing.In 1970 Steve was 20 and started working. His first job paid him R4 000 per year. Steve was a diligent saver and decided to save 10% of his salary annually. This means that his contributions increased at the same rate as his salary throughout his career, up to his retirement at age 65 in 2015.Steve did not trust his financial planner s advice by regularly investing in the market, and kept his money in a bank account where it earned interest. He reasoned that he ll put it into the market when it feels like the right time. The problem was that he only had the courage to enter the market after a huge run up. All of his money went into a JSE Alsi Index fund in March 1974[1]. Unfortunately, the South African Stock Exchange dropped more than 40% in the next two and a half years.Yet he did have one saving grace. Once he was in the market, he never disinvested.Remember this decision because it s a big one.Steve wasn t comfortable to invest again until October 1980, after another huge bull market. His savings of R5 000 went into a JSE/Alsi Index Fund just before the market lost more than 38% in short order. As before, he stayed invested. Only in August 1987 he again plucked up the courage to move about R12 000 from his savings account into his JSE investment. History shows that the SA stock market then lost more than 40% in less than six months.Steve waited to invest again until the tech and emerging market bubble in 1998. He used R62 000 of his savings to purchase shares in April 1998, just before a downturn of nearly 40% in just four months.This left Steve with more scars, but he made one more big purchase before he retired. In October 2007 he invested R120 000 (saved since 1998) to complete his record of horrific market timing by buying right before the global financial crisis.After this his savings (R160 000) went into a bank account, but he kept his stock investments in the market until he retired.To recap, Steve s only stock market purchases were at market peaks, just before extreme losses.Below are the purchase dates; subsequent crashes; and the amounts invested:&nbsp;Date of InvestmentSubsequent CrashAmount InvestedMarch 197442%R1 900October 198039%R5 100August 198743%R12 400April 199840%R62 100October 200740%R113 000&nbsp;Luckily, he never sold out of the market even once. Neither after the bear markets of 1973-74 and the Eighties; the technology bust in 2000; nor after the financial crisis of 2007-09.&nbsp;Source: SuppliedFollowing his financial planner s advice (at least part of it) he never redeemed his investments. So how did he do?Steve still ended up a millionaire with R4.2 million. This return beats South African inflation over this period by more than 4% annually. It sounds almost too good to be true, but here s why:Steve was a committed saver. He never wavered on his savings goals and increased the savings amount over time.He allowed his investments to compound through the decades by never selling, thereby giving himself a really long runway.He did endure stress from seeing large losses while sticking to his long-term plan, but never paid much attention to his portfolio statements. He just kept his head down and saved. Finally, he had a simple and sensibly-priced investment plan one strategy (growth assets in the form of South African equities) that was appropriate given his very long-term investment horizon.Footnote:Obviously, this story was for illustrative purposes. A portfolio of 100% in shares in a single market (e.g. JSE All Share Index) is not recommended, unless you have an extremely high risk tolerance. Even then a balanced portfolio in different global markets with a sound rebalancing policy makes more sense.If Steve simply rand cost averaged into the market on an annual basis, he would have had more money in the end (over R12.6 million, 8.5% ahead of inflation).But then he wouldn t be Steve, South Africa s Worst Market Timer.[1] Given that there were no index funds in 1974 we used the JSE All Share Index less a 0.40% expense ratios.Janet Hugo is director of Sterling Private Clients and a Certified Financial Planner.
