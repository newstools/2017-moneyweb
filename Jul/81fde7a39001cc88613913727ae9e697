Franchising is big business in South African and many entrepreneurs want to pursue this as an opportunity to grow their wealth. Moneyweb and the Franchising Association of South Africa have recently run a series of video interviews with franchising professionals and funding challenges for the sector. Check it out now on MoneywebTV.MARC ASHTON: Welcome to our franchising in focus podcast, today I m joined on the line by Kobus Engelbrecht, marketing head at Sanlam Business Market. Kobus, thanks very much for joining us.KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: Thank you for having me.MARC ASHTON: We are going through a really fascinating time in the South African business sector at the moment, everyone is always talking about the small business market being the lifeblood of the South African economy but when you look at it small businesses in South Africa are really struggling. The major industries &#8211; financial services, education, agri, mining &#8211; all seem to be taking an enormous amount of strain. Maybe as a starting point, give us your gut feel about what the state of the SME market is in South Africa at the moment.KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: The small business market is really like defining a length of a piece of string because, what is small and what is medium and what is big? So let&#8217;s focus on what we, as Sanlam term, the business owner market &#8211; where you have an active person who is also part-owner or sole owner of a business and is also actively involved in the management of the business. You will find small start-up businesses struggling very, very much, then you will have businesses that have been established for a while with larger turnover and they are doing extremely well. I am one of the judges of the Entrepreneur of the Year competition, sponsored by Sanlam and Business Partners, and over the weekend I reviewed the 15 finalists and there are fantastic stories.There are business owners who in the past year have doubled their turnover and that s not from R1 million to R2 million, in one particular case it s from R5 million to R10 million.So some of these businesses are doing extremely well and yes, most of the start-ups, the smaller businesses, are struggling. But then I also want to add onto what you said about there being a lot of talk about the small business sector in South Africa, I think that is the big problem, there is just too much talk and not much happening from the government s side or, for that matter, anybody who is really putting a focus on this market and do something about it.MARC ASHTON: So where would you go to look and see if it should be concentrated then, if you see and I think you can see it there s a lot of hype and a lot of talk around small business but are there easy wins that you think we should be looking at in the South African economy from a small business perspective?KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: Are you talking about specific sectors where it would be more lucrative for small business to focus?MARC ASHTON: Yes, absolutely, I think you look at the mining sector and you think there s a lot of politics that s happening there, but are there other industries where there might be wins that should be looking at?KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: The mining industry is largely for big business, you need to have very, very deep pockets to dig a hole in the ground and only after a number of years to start producing profits. So I would certainly not focus on the mining sector if I were to start a smaller business in South Africa.One of the obvious sectors that is doing very well in the South African economy is the hospitality sector. South Africa is an attractive holiday destination for people earning pounds and euros and US dollars. So if you can carve out a niche in a beautiful part of the country, and most parts of our country are very beautiful, and run a business that s focusing on tourism I think you are going to do well. You don t necessarily have to build a guesthouse, what about tour operators or providing food or being a supplier to the hospitality industry&#8230;Current state of franchising in SAMARC ASHTON: It s very encouraging that you ve come out with a bit of optimism, I think the one thing we need in South Africa at the moment is a few good news stories and a bit of optimism around the sector. The focus of this podcast is primarily around franchising and I wanted to zone in on this because at the moment, franchising is obviously a fantastic sector for a number of players who have been able to establish some great businesses but you talk about the owner-managed type business, franchise owners tend to be quite closely linked to their businesses, they don t tend to look at them from afar, what s your take on the franchising sector in South Africa?KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: It will again depend on what your target market is, so if your franchise is focused on a low-income target market and you are supplying services or products to that market segment, which they might regard as luxuries, then you are not going to do well. However, if you are focusing on the low income market and you are supplying services and products that they deem to be essential they are still going to buy that because they need that and you re going to do well. So it will depend on your product offering, exactly who your target market is. I ve spoken to a franchisor in the food industry in KwaZulu-Natal and they are focusing on preparing food like sandwiches and hamburgers and stuff like that but focusing on the very low-income market and they are doing extremely well because their product fit with their target market is very good. So, again, it will depend on what you are offering to whom.MARC ASHTON: Looking at personal experience I have previously tried my hand at starting a couple of small businesses and one of the things that you find quite quickly is that starting a business from scratch is an incredibly costly exercise, it places an enormous drain on the personal capital of an individual, particularly if you are funding it with credit cards or loan facilities. You guys specialise in looking at the finances associated with the business owners who will subsequently go on to run things like franchises. When you look at them what makes a franchise owner more attractive than perhaps a start-up like Marc who decides he s going to jump in and start a business using his own personal capital, what makes it more attractive for you as potential client?KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: Well, a franchise is connected to a brand, so if that is a well-known brand, and we all know many of them, and somebody is buying a franchise of that well-known brand then anybody who will be financing that operation would have the comfort of the brand having been established for a period of time and they can look at the finances of different franchises in that particular brand, which gives you a bit of a history. But that is not a guarantee because if you are an established brand and you are oversupplying a particular area then obviously the red lights would go on for any financier. But in essence it s about an established brand, it s well known and you have a history but then on the other side if you just franchised your business and now you are starting to sell franchises to franchisees then obviously you don t have that benefit and, again, that would then be less attractive for a financier. So to make a blanket statement that financing a franchise is easier than financing someone who is starting out from scratch is not in all cases true.Keeping personal and business finances separate MARC ASHTON: I think when you start a business and you re an entrepreneur you tend to mix up your personal finances between the business and your own personal balance sheet. I think one of the things you do is you often don t realise how much trouble you are getting yourself into when you keep trying to dig yourself out of trouble in terms of financing a business. You guys are often looking at this from a holistic perspective, looking at the business owner and saying, well, what is the state of their personal balance sheet, where do they need cover, the type of products that will probably be applicable to them, if you like the phrase the canary in the coalmine or the warning signs for a business owner that they are getting themselves in too deep or overextending themselves.KOBUS ENGELBRECHT: I would firstly look at cash flow because that will be an early warning sign. When you start a business it s very important that you keep your personal balance sheet and your income statement separate from that of your business and I would say starting the right way of doing that would be to start a company and run your business in the company, you are the shareholder in that company and if you have to finance the business yourself you make loans to the company and in that way you ve got a very clear picture of what does your personal balance sheet look like and what does the company s balance sheet look like.What we often find is that people get that mixed up, especially a first-time business owner, they just jump in and they use their personal resources, their car, their phone, they finance the business and this whole thing is just one big mess. You can t distinguish between what your private assets are and those assets of the business. It doesn t need to be complicated and you don t have to buy expensive software packages as a bookkeeping system, if your business is quite simple then you can run your finances on a spreadsheet but you just make sure that you are absolutely meticulous in doing that. One of the other canaries in the coal mine would obviously be if you look at your personal balance sheet and you are seeing that you are starting to borrow money that is approaching exceeding your assets because then you are on the way to bankruptcy.You always have to keep an eye on that but, like I said in the beginning, the early detector would be cash flow, is your cash flow positive or negative and you must be able at any time of the day or night be able to produce a cash flow statement. It is not something that you do once in a while, it needs to be current because you must know when cash is going out and when cash is going in. Another thing that we found on the topic of personal finance is many people who start a business scrape together all the cash that they have, they cash in all the policies they have and with the attitude that once the business is doing well then they will take out life insurance and disability insurance again. Please don t do that because I have seen so many heart-sore stories of people doing that and then the business owner dies before he has reinstated his life insurance or, even worse, becomes disabled and now he can t carry on with his business, he can t look after himself, he can t look after his family. So there are certain fundamentals that you need to keep in place.MARC ASHTON: Kobus, I appreciate you taking the time to chat to Moneyweb.
