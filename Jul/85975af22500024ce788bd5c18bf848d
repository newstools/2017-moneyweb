HARARE &#8211; South African logistics group Transnet has bid to recapitalise National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) with $400 million, the State Procurement Board (SPB) said on Tuesday.NRZ is saddled with a debt of $200 million and has gone for months without paying its workers as Zimbabwe&#8217;s experiences a serious dollar crunch and electricity shortages.Transnet made the bid jointly with Diaspora Investment Group, a group of Zimbabwean investors living abroad, the SPB said at its offices in the capital Harare.The board also said Malaysia&#8217;s SMH Railway has bid to spend $100.7 million to refurbish locomotives for NRZ, while the Zimbabwean operations of chartered accountants group Crowe Horwath International said it could secure funding of up to $2.5 billion for the state railway company.In another bid, local firm Croyeaux Pvt said it would be able to organise $700 million in debt to recapitalise NRZ.&#8220;Within the next coming 10 days we should actually be able to come up with a recommendation as to who the winning bidder is,&#8221; NRZ chairman Larry Mavhima told reporters after the opening of six bids.&#8220;What we are looking for is an investment in NRZ, whether its in debt form or equity and its not about buying a certain number of locomotives only,&#8221; Mavhima said
