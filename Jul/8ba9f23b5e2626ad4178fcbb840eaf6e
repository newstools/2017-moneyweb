Asset management firm Inkunzi Wealth Group is preparing to list a student housing property portfolio on the JSE a nascent sector that it believes offers better growth prospects than office, retail and industrial properties.A successful listing of the Inkunzi Student Accommodation Fund (ISAF), with a R2.25 billion property portfolio, would make it the first purely student housing fund on the JSE s more than R400 billion real estate sector.ISAF will list as a real estate investment trust (Reit) in September on the JSE s main board.Owen Nkomo, ISAF s co-founder and chief investment officer, said its property portfolio comprises of approximately 6 500 beds across SA, which are already occupied by students from universities and private tertiary institutions. The student accommodation market is defensive as even when the economy is under pressure students still continue with their studies and there is a high demand versus supply of quality student accommodation, Nkomo told Moneyweb.ISAF has an occupancy rate of between 97% and 100% on most of its properties and about 50% of leases are with universities, and the balance is comprised of private tertiary institutions and students. Monthly rentals across its portfolio, which is internally managed, are pitched from R1 800 up to R6 000.Although the recent nationwide student protests have been premised on tuition fees and academic exclusion, the ructions have also cast a spotlight on the increasing student accommodation backlog. Industry players have pegged the shortage of student beds across tertiary institutions in the country at more than 300 000.In 2015, the Department of Higher Education and Training gazetted a policy on standards of student housing and allocated close to R1.7 billion for student housing projects. However, this budget hardly made a dent as it was insufficient for 26 universities and other tertiary institutions.Despite the shortages, the JSE real estate sector s exposure to student housing is small. For example, student housing only makes up a small portion of the larger retail, office and industrial property portfolio of sector heavyweight Redefine Properties. The counter owns a 51% stake in Respublica, which manages more than 6 000 student beds. CampusKey, which manages about 3 700 beds across SA, is eyeing a JSE listing in the next to two to three years.Nkomo said ISAF has an immediate pipeline of further properties worth R2.5 billion, which would grow the number of beds in the group. Upon listing, it will have a loan-to-value of 25%.Kameel Keshav, the co-founder and CEO of ISAF, said a big focus for the company will be Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE), as it plans to have a 25% to 30% direct black ownership (excluding institutional investors and banks).The ownership of previously disadvantaged groups will be done through a staff incentive plan, targeting high-net-worth black individuals in the Inkunzi Wealth network and an independent retail investment platform (in the form of a special purpose vehicle) with its own board of trustees. About 100 of our staff from CEO to administrative staff including building cleaners, security, gardeners, will all participate in the staff incentive scheme allowing direct ownership and an equity stake in the business, said Keshav.ISAF is targeting a level one BEE rating, which is the highest standard for empowerment. Keshav said this would assist ISAF obtain long term contracts, specifically with university procurement departments that are now stringent on empowerment credentials. In the last two years, no fewer than 14 Reits have listed on the JSE, creating the need for specialised investments in various subsectors of property, including self-storage, warehouse and distribution centres and residential property.Stanlib listed property analyst Lawrence Koikoi said specialist Reits tend to attract a premium forward yield rating over time. Student accommodation will expand investors options to the specialist Reit segment of the market and if it is run well with increasing size and returns on a per share basis it is likely to attract a good rating over time, he said.Peter Clark, the portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management, supported Koikoi s view saying student housing has some appealing dynamics but funds would need critical mass and scale to be supported by investors. Institutional investors generally have higher size and liquidity requirements, however, private investors and wealth managers often like these types of niche companies, and may be supportive when they are smaller, said Clark.
