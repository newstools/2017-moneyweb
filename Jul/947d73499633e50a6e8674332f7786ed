JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Activity in South Africa&#8217;s private sector fell to its lowest in 14 months in June as employment, output and new orders slipped, a survey showed on Wednesday.The Standard Bank Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, dropped to 49.0 in June from 50.2 in May, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The reading was the index&#8217;s lowest since April 2016.&#8220;The employment sub-component reflected the largest decline in June, followed by output and new orders. Stocks of purchases also fell, although its subtraction from the overall index was more muted in June,&#8221; Standard Bank strategist Shireen Darmalingam said.&#8220;We expect the index to remain pressured as the South African economy battles with low business confidence and slow economic activity as reflected in the recent recessionary (first quarter) GDP data.&#8221;Political instability, high unemployment and credit-rating downgrades have hit business and consumer confidence in South Africa, which entered recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter.Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 27.7%.
