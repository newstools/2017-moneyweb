JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African construction group Aveng said on Monday it has ended talks on the sale of its Aveng Trident Steel business due to a failure to reach agreement on price.Work for South Africa&#8217;s construction industry has slowed sharply as government contracts stall and weak commodity prices hit demand from the mining industry. Companies have had to employ new strategies to survive in a sector stunted by an economy that is not expected to grow at all.&#8220;With the termination of negotiations, we are intending to further strengthen Aveng Trident Steel, including capitalising on its leading position within the automotive sector,&#8221; said chief executive Kobus Verster in a statement.Verster also said that the conclusion of a long-running dispute in relation to claims on the Australian Queensland Curtis Liquefied Natural Gas (QCLNG) Export Pipeline project has resulted in a cash inflow to the group of R508 million ($39 million).On settlement of the QCLNG award the group will significantly reduce net debt by R508 million, the company said. As at June 30 the group&#8217;s net debt was R1.07 billion.Shares in Aveng were down 3.26% at R5.63 at 1044 GMT. ($1 = R13.1188)
