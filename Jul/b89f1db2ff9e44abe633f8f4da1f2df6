The recent ANC policy conference sounded a note around prescribed assets and this set off a few warning signs for the industry.Government has effectively said it can t fund many of its activities and wants to propose (or mandate) that pension funds and retirement products are invested in these activities. Put a different way, government would require a percentage of your retirement funds to be invested with them.In a normal world, this wouldn t be a bad thing and there are many South African asset managers who generate excellent returns by buying into government debt instruments. Businesses like Sasol were built in the apartheid era on the basis of prescribed assets when international capital markets were closed to South Africans. However, these are not normal times in South Africa:Investors need solutions not problemsIn a previous Moneyweb column, we highlighted the opportunity cost of having your investments purely focused on South Africa over the last five years. The recent ANC policy conference didn t appear to give any clear ideas on how South Africa would turn around its economic challenges and markets once again were jolted with the announcement that the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) was to become a political tool.You as a South African investor cannot afford another two years of poor local returns while government tries to return the country to a growth path.If government is going to target your retirement savings to fund this growth agenda, you effectively have two levers to pull: superior returns or a higher savings level.We believe that a very simple solution to mitigate risk would be to work along the following lines:The reality is that the country faces a mountain of social and economic challenges and it is going to fall to ordinary salary-earning South Africans to fund many of these challenges. Retirement calculators and financial planner models don t factor in working for the South African government for six to eight months of the year. South African professionals have the tools to mitigate some of this risk, they simply need to prioritise thinking about them.Iwan Swiegers is director at Capilis Asset Managers.
