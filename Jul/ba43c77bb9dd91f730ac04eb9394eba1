Vodacom Group sees the expansion of mobile-banking services into new markets in sub-Saharan Africa as a top priority following a shareholder vote to rubber stamp its purchase of a 35% stake in Safaricom, Kenya s biggest company. We will use Safaricom to enter other markets where neither Vodacom nor Safaricom are, Chief Executive Officer Shameel Joosub said in an interview at the wireless carrier s annual general meeting in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The two businesses have a combined 30 million mobile-banking customers, giving them a very sizeable platform on the continent, he said.Vodacom s purchase of the Safaricom stake from UK parent company Vodafone Group gives the South African company access to the fast-growing M-Pesa platform, which processed about 891 billion shillings ($8.5 billion) in the three months through March, or more than 75% of Kenya s total, according to the country s telecommunications regulator. Entering markets through its financial services platform will allow Vodacom to access countries without having to purchase a voice license, Joosub said.Mobile-payments are popular in countries with limited banking infrastructure, which includes much of sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa, Vodacom s biggest market. The company plans to compete with the mobile-money services of Millicom International Cellular, Bharti Airtel and Orange SA, Joosub said.Vodacom shares declined 0.41% to R173.57 at the close in Johannesburg, valuing the company at R258 billion ($20 billion). Almost all shareholders voted in favour of the Safaricom deal at the Tuesday meeting. 2017 Bloomberg
