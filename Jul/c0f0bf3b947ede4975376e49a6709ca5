Financial planners will consistently remind you that time in the market is far more important than timing the market. The argument will consistently be made that it all comes down to compounding interest. These financial planners probably have a point.But what they fail to disclose is that the majority of retirement calculators that they are using, assume that the stock market will double every seven years. But if the JSE has delivered less than 1% in the last three years in total, is on track for a poor 2017 and will face a mountain of uncertainty until the 2019 elections, then your retirement plan has effectively lost six years of a seven-year cycle.When building offshore portfolios using exchange-traded funds and equity for South African professionals who cannot afford to lose a full seven-year cycle in the wealth-building process, due to political factors, we have to look at it from two aspects:The rand is vulnerable right nowThere are few things more satisfying than receiving a dividend in dollars and multiplying it by 13 to get your rand value.One of the big surprises of 2017 is that the rand has actually held up relatively well despite the weak outlook for the South African economy and the political tension as the ANC builds up to the process of electing new leadership.If you look at the analysis done by a number of top investment research houses, this looks likely to change in the coming months:South Africa has potential, but so do a lot of others&nbsp;I would love to tell you to buy South African banks right now. On historical earnings they are cheap, the dividends are juicy and the consensus forecast on almost all of them is to buy . But they are cheap for a reason: investors simply don t trust the investment landscape in South Africa.The health of the banking sector is typically a good proxy for the state of an economy and we decided to do a bit of a comparison between the major banking groups in the US and South Africa over the last five years.We took the five biggest banks in the US and the big four in South Africa plus Investec.Source: BloombergIt is quite a crowded graph but in summary, South Africa s best-performing banking group* was Investec with a 95% return while the worst performer was Barclays Group Africa with a 6.4% return. In contrast, the best-performing US group was Bank of America with 214% and the worst of the big banks was Wells Fargo with a 67% return. The outperformance of US banks is clear and one needs to take into consideration that the US went through a bruising election, President Trump is one of the most unpopular presidents ever elected and there are no shortage of people who wake up in the morning and warily check Twitter to find out if he has started World War 3 with North Korea.Your retirement annuities are already heavily exposed to South African banks because they are blue chips in the South African environment, but globally they have been underperformers and this has a material impact on your investment portfolio in the long-run.Yes South African banks are attractively priced, but so are banks in the US, Europe, UK, Japan and China. As asset managers, our job is to try and limit downside risk and not many of the international banking groups face the same level of populist rhetoric and funding challenges in the coming years. The inclusion of Capitec would have changed the picture significantly but pension fund and RA exposure to Capitec remains relatively low.Steinman de Bruyn is director at Capilis Asset Managers.
