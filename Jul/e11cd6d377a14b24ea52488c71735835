Publishing group Caxton has been growing its digital footprint through Caxton Digital, which includes a portfolio of data collection, data management and programmatic advertising.&#8220;We have been attracting more online users in the digital space steadily for the last three years,&#8221; says Nicole Rimbault, GM of Caxton Digital. &#8220;According to Effective Measure&#8217;s May statistics, Caxton Digital is the third-largest South African digital publisher.&#8221;Adding to the 78 local newspaper websites drawing north of 3.1 million users across all the sites, Caxton has provided innovation through its classifieds technology business Hozi &#8211; a division of Caxton Digital. The technology allows a publisher website to integrate classifieds portals as a sub-domain into their environment with little effort.All Caxton newspaper sites now have integrated platforms that allow users to search for property and business listings in their town. Further strategic acquisitions and partnerships include the likes of one of SA&#8217;s biggest female interest websites www.all4women.co.za and Guzzle Media &amp; Technology, a business offering online catalogue aggregation and technology for retailers. A big piece of the digital puzzle for Caxton has been large investment into data collection and data management. Caxton has chosen to invest in the Oracle Bluekai Data Management Platform in order to collect high quality audiences across the entire group, including The Citizen, Local News Network, All4women, Ramsay Media, Caxton Magazines, Guzzle and Autodealer. This data collection gives advertisers the opportunity to talk to people who have shown an interest in their product/service category. Clients have access to the Caxton group s network of sites through SPARK Media and via programmatic buying desks. The combination of a large interest based audience with rich data overlays becomes an attractive offering for advertisers.&#8220;Not only have we been making huge strides into the digital space, but they have been strategically correct moves that have benefitted our readers and advertisers,&#8221; concludes Rimbault.
