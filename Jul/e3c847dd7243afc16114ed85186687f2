South Africa&#8217;s Treasury will unveil an action plan on Friday detailing structural changes and timelines to boost growth to 6% in an economy mired in recession, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Monday.The plan will be released after a policy conference of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) wraps up, a meeting overshadowed by a power struggle between rivals seeking to succeed President Jacob Zuma.&#8220;We will implement steps to get the economy growing at about 6% and more&#8221;, Gigaba said at an event marking the launch of the tax-filing season in Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy.&#8220;We want to get everyone focused on boosting the economy &#8230; so that the low growth doesn&#8217;t become a vicious cycle.&#8221;South Africa&#8217;s economy contracted 0.7% in the first three months of 2017 after shrinking 0.3% in the previous quarter, piling pressure on Zuma whose missteps, including the sacking of Gigaba&#8217;s highly-respected predecessor Pravin Gordhan in March, have corroded investor confidence.Proposals being debated at the ANC&#8217;s conference which have unnerved investors include holding a referendum on land reform and a push for the expropriation of land without compensation and greater black ownership of businesses.But Gigaba pointedly said the action plan would draw on issues raised by investors and ratings agencies.South Africa&#8217;s credit rating was recently downgraded by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch to junk status. South African Revenue Service (SARS) commissioner Tom Moyane said at the same event as Gigaba that he was confident of reaching the R1.62 trillion revenue target set out in the February budget despite the recession.Read Tax season starts: Four things you should know&#8220;We have scanned the horizon and seen that companies are already shedding jobs &#8230; But we are confident of reaching our target,&#8221; Moyane said.
