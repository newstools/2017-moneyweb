The Banking Association South Africa notes the Inclusive Growth Action Plan announced last week by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. We are in agreement with the minister on the main problems facing our economy.However, the solutions to slow growth, rising debt, SOE underperformance and low confidence lie in policy action and implementation, not just planning.The second point of the minister s 14-point plan addresses the financial sector and tax policy, identifying four primary interventions. These are highly worthwhile engagements, but in fact the sector and government are already engaging on the very issues raised. Nonetheless, we support any further such dialogue that will support inclusive growth.The minister&#8217;s plan proposes convening a financial-sector summit to quantify transformation targets, including for low-income housing and transformational agriculture. The Banking Association South Africa is already engaging with government and other social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on the convening of a financial sector summit in April 2018. The timing of the summit is informed by work that must be completed before the summit and we believe the minister should support this initiative. The areas referred to by the minister are also contained in the Financial Sector Code, which is overseen by the Financial Sector Charter Council, on which National Treasury and DTI are represented.On the plan s second issue of bringing down banking costs by implementing Twin Peaks , we absolutely support the Twin Peaks approach, which will be implemented as part of the Financial Sector Regulation Bill awaiting the president s ratification.In our view, Twin Peaks will co-ordinate the regulation of the financial sector, which could bring down costs, although it also introduces additional regulatory costs. Twin Peaks aims to make the financial sector safe, responsible and responsive through the establishment of a new regulator to monitor financial conduct and prudential conduct.The next planned intervention encourages working with the DTI on targeted debt relief. We are already engaging robustly and frequently with the DTI s portfolio committee in parliament, which will produce a committee bill on debt relief.As far as reviewing the co-operative bank framework, we are on record as saying co-operative banks are a way to diversify the financial sector. We have a Co-operatives Banks Act in place. Whatever blockages there are in the licensing of co-operatives banks must be identified and removed. We remain more than willing to engage on this issue and on any initiatives that will help diversify our sector.We note the interventions the minister is proposing, particularly in the financial sector. Most are already in progress in some form at Nedlac, the Financial Sector Charter Council, the DTI Portfolio Committee and other fora, providing healthy platforms for engagement.We remain committed to working with government and other social partners on the matters raised by the minister, but must stress that it is in government&#8217;s domain to rebuild confidence, trust and certainty, all of which have been destroyed as a result of the president&#8217;s actions in March this year.Beyond outlining action plans, we need an assurance that government will not act again as it did in March, when the former finance minister was recalled from an investor roadshow and him and his deputy were fired, without any reason, on March 31.These interventions caused incalculable harm to South Africa s image as an investment destination and they are what in fact caused the recent credit ratings downgrades to sub-investment grade.Government also needs to demonstrate that it will, with urgency, deal with the governance and management issues at state-owned institutions.If we are to attract investment that drives inclusive growth, government needs to actively address policy uncertainty, not just plan to do so. It needs to assure the business community and the country that it will not act in a way that actually inhibits, even sabotages growth.Cas Coovadia is managing director of the Banking Association South Africa
