PRETORIA &#8211; South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago defended its independence on Monday in the face of a recommendation by the country&#8217;s main anti-graft watchdog agency that the central bank&#8217;s mandate should be changed.Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane set off a political row this month when she called for an overhaul of the bank&#8217;s mandate &#8211; to focus on growth rather than inflation and the currency &#8211; rattling investors and hitting the rand hard.The central bank has since filed a court challenge to quash the recommendation. On Friday, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba echoed criticism of the recommendation by parliament and the ruling party, accusing the agency of overstepping the mark.&#8220;The Reserve Bank is respected because the people who are leading the institution are acting according to the constitution. I am acting according to the constitution and I am acting independently, without fear, favour and prejudice,&#8221; Kganyago said at a public lecture on monetary policy.&#8220;It is then for South Africans to say yes, we respect this institution, and when the institution is under attack, they should be able to say: hands off our Reserve Bank.&#8221;South Africa is immersed in political rows over President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s leadership, with the 75-year-old facing calls to resign over various scandals. Zuma denies any wrongdoing.The credit rating of Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country has been downgraded to &#8220;junk&#8221; by two of the three biggest rating agencies, the economy has slipped into recession and the unemployment rate is close to 28%, a 14-year high.The row over the central bank&#8217;s mandate has raised fears of further economic turmoil.In an editorial in the Sunday Times newspaper, Kganyago said South Africa risked slipping into a long and painful economic recession if the central bank was forced to abandon its policy of reducing inflation and protecting the currency.
