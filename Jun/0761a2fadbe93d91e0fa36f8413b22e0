Q: I m 31 and planning to move to Ireland in the next few months, so I need to decide what to do with the money ( R550 000) in my provident fund. I can&#8217;t decide if I should invest it here in SA, or overseas, and I don&#8217;t know what the tax implications are if I do decide to invest it overseas. I&#8217;m not planning to return to SA, so it makes more sense to invest overseas, I think? If so, where do I start?&nbsp;A: Considering that you are not planning to return to South Africa, I will assume that you are formally emigrating or at the least considering a formal emigration. An emigrant is subject to the same legal requirements; to the extent it is relevant, as a traveller leaving the Republic, therefore you would have to declare all your financial possessions including your liabilities before leaving with the relevant authorities including, but not limited to the South African Revenue Services (Sars), the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb), etc.One of the reasons why I would encourage you to opt for the formal emigration is to avoid any potential future complications in reference to your annuity income in a foreign country. Most countries impose tax on the worldwide income earned by a resident of that country and on income earned by non-residents on locally-earned income. Therefore, someone could be double taxed because they could be taxed in the country of residence as well as in the country where the income was earned.Certain countries have agreements to avoid double taxation. Normally these agreements provide that income of a certain nature will be taxed only in one of the two countries or may be taxed in both countries and the country of residence will allow a credit for the tax which has been imposed by source country. South Africa has agreements with a number of countries to prevent double taxation of income, subject to future change in relationships between the countries and legislative change.Where to startHow long does the financial emigration process take?Estimated turnaround time, from submitting your documents to accessing your funds, could well be six months barring any unforeseen circumstances of course. As a guideline, the timeline goes as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
