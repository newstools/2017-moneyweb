JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Anti-corruption watchdog will oppose President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s court bid to set aside an influence-peddling report, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said on Monday.The Public Protector, a constitutionally-mandated watchdog, released the report in November last year, after an extensive probe over allegations of influence-peddling against Zuma, whose administration has been marred by scandals.The carefully worded report by Thuli Madonsela, Mkhwebane predecessor, stopped short of asserting that crimes had been committed and called for a judge to investigate the allegations.Zuma has denied any wrongdoing, and is challenging the Public Protector&#8217;s report in court.
