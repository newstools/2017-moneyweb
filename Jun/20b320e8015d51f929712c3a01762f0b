South African diversified chemicals maker Omnia Holdings&#8217; full-year profit dropped 7% as a tough economic environment hit its mining and chemicals divisions, the company said on Tuesday.Headline earnings per share (EPS), the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items, fell to 881 cents for the year ended March 31 from 944 cents in the previous period.The fertiliser, chemicals and mining explosives maker said its profit after tax was down 8% to R592 million ($46 million) following lower operating profit.&#8220;The slowdown in global economic activity remains a key driver for the demand of the various commodities and therefore, the inability for a sustained increase in prices for Omnia&#8217;s products to materialise in the short to medium term,&#8221; said Omnia in a statement.Group revenue dipped to R16.3 billion on a weaker performance from the Mining and Chemicals divisions.The mining unit saw revenue fall 4% to R4.4 billion following a challenging year for the mining industry, with lower volumes due to mine closures in South Africa and business lost in Botswana and Namibia, the company said.Revenue in the agriculture division remained relatively flat at R8.2 billion, with record sales volumes for speciality fertilisers both locally and internationally.
