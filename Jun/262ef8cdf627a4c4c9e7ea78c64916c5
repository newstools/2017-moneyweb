Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Policy hawksThe last two weeks of comments from the world&#8217;s most important central bankers have prompted investors to reassess the outlook for the second half of 2017. The euro was trading at $1.1420 at 5:20am Eastern Time, continuing a climb which was briefly interrupted yesterday by a suggestion from the European Central Bank that markets have been over-interpreting Mario Draghi&#8217;s speech. The pound briefly traded above $1.30 this morning as it also got a lift from Bank of England policy makers&#8217; increasingly hawkish comments. This marks the seventh day of gains for the currency; its longest winning streak since April 2015. Travel banThe US will institute new restrictions on travel from six Muslim-majority countries at 8pm this evening, according to a person familiar with the matter. For travelers to the US from other countries, the laptop ban won&#8217;t be applied, but there will be a broad range of heightened security measures, including more thorough vetting of passengers and enhanced screening of electronic devices. In Washington, GOP holdouts blocking the health-care bill can&#8217;t agree what they want changed for it to proceed. Bond slumpThe message from central bankers that borrowing costs are going to go up has been received by the bond market. The yield on US Treasuries has risen 10 basis points since Tuesday, with German bund yields rising 15 basis points to 0.40% over the same time. UK gilts are also getting hit, with the yield on the two-year note hitting the highest level since Brexit referendum. Markets mixedOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.6%, with Japan&#8217;s Topix index also gaining 0.6% as banks in the region rallied. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.3% lower at 5:50am as neither a rally in banks or a decade-high for euro-area consumer confidence managed to lift the wider index. S&amp;P 500 futures were 0.1% higher, with markets due to give their assessment of the surprisingly large payouts from US banks after the stress test results.Coming up&#8230;At 6:30am Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is interviewed by Bloomberg TV. At 8:30am weekly initial jobless claims data for the US are released with expectations for a broadly unchanged reading from last week&#8217;s 241 000. The third reading of Q1 GDP is due at the same time.
