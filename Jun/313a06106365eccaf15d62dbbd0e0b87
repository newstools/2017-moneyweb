South Africa&#8217;s anti-graft watchdog will investigate the government&#8217;s providing of protection services to former African Union (AU) Commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, its spokesman said on Sunday.Dlamini-Zuma, once married to President Jacob Zuma and seen as a front-runner to succeed him, in March concluded her five-year tenure as AU Commission chairwoman and has made several public appearances in South Africa since.An investigation into Dlamini-Zuma, seen as Zuma&#8217;s preferred candidate by political analysts, is bad news for the scandal-plagued president who survived a no-confidence vote by his own party&#8217;s highest body last week.The Democratic Alliance (DA), the largest opposition party, in April complained that Dlamini-Zuma is enjoying protection services afforded to visiting heads of state or elected representatives, while she holds no official position.&#8220;Dlamini-Zuma is a clear candidate in the ANC leadership succession race, and her use of VIP Presidential Protection as she campaigns is clearly another ANC abuse of public money,&#8221; the Democratic Alliance said in a statement on Sunday.The Public Protector&#8217;s spokeswoman, Cleopatra Mosana, said the anti-graft watchdog will investigate Dlamini-Zuma&#8217;s use of VIP protection services.&#8220;Yes it will,&#8221; she said, without elaborating.The African National Congress&#8217; women&#8217;s league endorsed the party veteran and former minister as presidential candidate in January, though the ruling party has not officially given the go-ahead to campaign for an elective conference in December.
