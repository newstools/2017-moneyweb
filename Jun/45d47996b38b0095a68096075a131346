Belamant will also be paid $50 000 a month to consult for the company after his early retirement. Net1 s second-biggest shareholder Allan Gray said it was outraged and the biggest investor, the International Finance Corporation, said it was frustrated. We have to take cognizance of what they say, but on the other hand it s as a result of the initial steps taken by them that we ve ended up in a position where we ve agreed with Serge that he must take this early retirement package, Kotze told reporters in Kokstad, on the border of South Africa s Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, on Thursday. Belamant s three decades of service was taken into account, as was his income that was forfeited due to his early retirement, Kotze said. Belamant, who was paid $3.6 million in the 2016 financial year, was due to retire in 2018.Outraged investor There are accelerated stock options that had to be taken into account, restraint of trade, as well as the ownership of intellectual property issues, Kotze said.Net1 won a contract in 2012 to distribute welfare payments in South Africa.
