JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed on Wednesday ahead of consumer inflation data, as weakness in the dollar and other major currencies helped the local currency ride out concerns over a row between the central bank and the anti-graft watchdog.At 0650 GMT, the rand traded at 13.0275 per dollar, 0.33% firmer compared with its New York close of 13.0700 on Tuesday.The rand has retreated more than 2% in the last three sessions to three-week lows as a row over the independence of the central bank escalated after the head of South Africa&#8217;s anti-graft watchdog, called for the bank&#8217;s policy of currency and price stability to be changed.Markets responded negatively to the resurfacing of political uncertainty that has engulfed the country since President Jacob Zuma fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in late March.May inflation figures due at 0800 GMT are expected to show consumer prices remain soft, possibly giving room for the central bank to cut interest rates when its policy unit meets next month.In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 1.5 basis points to 8.555%.Stocks are set to open lower when trade resumes at 0700 GMT, with Top-40 futures index down 0.5%.&nbsp;
