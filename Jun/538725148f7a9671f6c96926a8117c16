CAPE TOWN &#8211; South African President Jacob Zuma said a secret ballot in parliament in a motion of no-confidence against him would not be fair as it was meant to help the opposition parties garner a majority they do not have.A secret ballot is seen by Zuma&#8217;s critics as emboldening lawmakers from his own party to support his ouster by shielding them from pressure.&#8220;I see no convincing reason why we should change&#8230; You are trying to get a majority you don&#8217;t have by saying secret ballot. I think it is not fair because you are trying to increase the majority you don&#8217;t have,&#8221; Zuma told parliament.
