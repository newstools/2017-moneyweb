LONDON &#8211; The UK&#8217;s top share index dropped to a three-week low on Thursday as Britons headed to the polls after a tumultuous campaign which saw Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s lead tighten in recent weeks.The major FTSE 100 benchmark slid steadily throughout the session to close 0.4% lower at 7 449.98 points, after the European Central Bank signalled an end to more interest rate cuts, and ahead of results from Britain&#8217;s parliamentary elections.Polls indicated Prime Minister May&#8217;s gamble on securing a bigger Conservative majority would be rewarded with a win, though the surprise 2016 vote to quit the European Union meant investors were considering all scenarios.Mid-caps have outperformed the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 so far this year but the blue-chips have gained back some ground in recent weeks as tightening polls prompted greater caution on domestic stocks.&#8220;Some investors, possibly the market makers, have been told to get their books fairly straight rather than having long positions in stocks that could take a caning,&#8221; said Paul Mumford, manager of the Cavendish opportunities fund.&#8220;If you were to get a coalition, or Labour win, or a very small, difficult-to-work Conservative result, then the market would take it quite badly in the short term, the pound would drop and this would provide a boost to the exporters,&#8221; he added.&#8220;So the FTSE 100 has performed relatively well because people want to have an overseas hedge.&#8221;Inversely, a bigger majority for the Conservatives could prompt institutions to pick up some bargains among mid-caps, Mumford said.US bank Citi advised investors to hedge political risk through the &#8220;UK 8&#8221;, a list of blue-chip stocks least exposed to domestic sales, while avoiding the &#8220;Anti UK 8&#8221; stocks with the greatest dependence on the British economy.Traders in the City of London prepared for a long night, with banks and brokers pulling in extra staff to cover for potential volatility as results trickle in.While macroeconomic events were front and centre of investors&#8217; minds, some company moves stood out.Centrica and SSE were among the top 10 blue-chip gainers. Their share prices have dipped in recent weeks as the election approached, with investors concerned about manifesto promises to cap energy prices or nationalise the companies.Firms going ex-dividend weighed, however, with Vodafone falling 4.8% and WPP down 2.7%.Among mid-caps, Berendsen jumped 11%, the most actively traded stock as investors cheered a merger with Elis after the French laundry firm sweetened its offer for the company.Elis&#8217; latest offer valued Berendsen at 2.2 billion pounds, or 1,250p a share, a 45% premium to its closing price before the initial takeover offer last month.Petrofac shares jumped more than 4%, among top European gainers, after the oil services firm sealed a 10-year deal with Petroleum Development Oman.
