Renewing a vehicle licence disc can be tedious and time-consuming process. First National Bank is hoping to change that by allowing its clients to renew their licence disk using its smartphone banking application.But the convenience comes at a price: FNB is charging a R199 handling and delivery fee per disc to take the hassle out of visiting the local post office or licensing department. This price excludes the renewal amount payable to the government.The bank has introduced a new Nav Car option in its app, in collaboration with vehicle finance provider and sister company WesBank, that is meant to help customers with their car maintenance needs, including the licence disc renewal with delivery.The launch of Nav Car comes after the bank launched Nav Home late last year. Nav Home allows FNB app users to search for properties, get free instant home value estimates and obtain home loan pre-approval.Fine notifications Apart from processing licence disc renewals, Nav Car allows users to receive instant fine notifications and, if they want to, they can pay their fines directly through the app.A bundle option called On-road Protect, which costs R95/month, offers vehicle licence renewal for up to five discs with free delivery, fine discounts (negotiated on the user s behalf), 24/7 bail assistance at roadblocks, and Road Accident Fund and tyre repair claim assistance due to pothole damage.Other bundles are planned, FNB said.
