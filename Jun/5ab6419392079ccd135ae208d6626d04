JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand traded firmer early on Thursday, boosted by a weaker dollar weighed down by disappointing economic data and waning bets that President Donald Trump&#8217;s fiscal stimulus plans will pass the post.At 0645 GMT the rand traded 0.15% firmer at 12.9200 per dollar compared to its overnight close of 12.9400 overnight in New York.Moves have mostly been determined by offshore factors with a lull in local political ructions and a dearth of economic data.The dollar index slipped to its weakest level since October as investors reassessed estimations of the pace of interest rate hikes and growth in the world&#8217;s number one economy.A recent batch of mixed economic data, including softer-than-expected house price figures on Wednesday, have dampened the lure of the greenback and previous bets that the Federal Reserve will lift rates further this year.South Africa releases producer price inflation figures for May at 0930 GMT with markets anticipating a sideways trend and little impact on currency markets.Local bonds were firmer, with the yield on the benchmark government issue due in 2026 down 2 basis points to 8.645%.Stocks were set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index up 0.36%.
