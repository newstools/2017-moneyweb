JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Ford Motor Co is recalling nearly 16 000 Ikon and Figo models in South Africa due to a potential fire risk, it said on Friday.The models were built between 2004 and 2012 in India, Ford said in a statement.&#8220;A power steering fluid leak could result in fumes being emitted from the engine compartment,&#8221; it said.&#8220;It may also be possible for power steering fluid to come into contact with the vehicle&#8217;s exhaust system components, creating the potential for smoke and, in extreme cases, fire.&#8221;Earlier this year in South Africa Ford recalled 4 500 Kuga SUVs following dozens of reports of the vehicles catching fire.
