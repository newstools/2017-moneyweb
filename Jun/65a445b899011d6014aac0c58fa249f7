British shares marked time on Thursday as Britons headed to the polls after a tumultuous campaign which saw Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s lead tighten in recent weeks.Trading was timid on the major FTSE 100 benchmark, which was up 0.1 percent by 0900 GMT ahead of results from Britain&#8217;s parliamentary elections and a rate decision by the European Central Bank.Polls indicated Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s gamble on securing a bigger Conservative majority would be rewarded with a win, though the surprise 2016 vote to quit the European Union meant investors were considering all scenarios.Mid-caps have outperformed the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 so far this year but the blue-chips have gained back some ground in recent weeks as tightening polls prompted greater caution on domestic stocks.&#8220;Some investors, possibly the market makers, have been told to get their books fairly straight rather than having long positions in stocks that could take a caning,&#8221; said Paul Mumford, manager of the Cavendish opportunities fund.&#8220;If you were to get a coalition, or Labour win, or a very small, difficult-to-work Conservative result, then the market would take it quite badly in the short term, the pound would drop and this would provide a boost to the exporters,&#8221; he added.&#8220;So the FTSE 100 has performed relatively well because people want to have an overseas hedge.&#8221;Inversely, a bigger majority for the Conservatives could prompt institutions to pick up some bargains among mid-caps, Mumford said.U.S. bank Citi advised investors to hedge political risk through the &#8220;UK 8&#8221;, a list of blue-chip stocks least exposed to domestic sales, while avoiding the &#8220;Anti UK 8&#8221; stocks with the greatest dependence on the British economy.Traders in the City of London prepared for a long night, with banks and brokers pulling in extra staff to cover for potential volatility as results trickle in.While macroeconomic events were front and centre of investors&#8217; minds, some company moves stood out.Centrica and SSE were among the top blue-chip gainers. Their share prices have dipped in recent weeks as the election approached, with investors concerned about manifesto promises to cap energy prices or nationalise the companies.&#8220;The prospect of nationalisation from a Labour government has caused investors to cool on the utilities sector,&#8221; said Kathleen Brooks, market analyst at City Index, in a note.Among mid-caps, Berendsen jumped 9 percent, the most actively traded stock as investors cheered a merger with Elis after the French laundry firm sweetened its offer for the company.Elis&#8217; latest offer valued Berendsen at 2.2 billion pounds, or 1,250p a share, a 45 percent premium to its closing price before the initial takeover offer last month.Petrofac shares jumped 6 percent, among top European gainers, after the oil services firm sealed a 10-year deal with Petroleum Development Oman.Petrofac was set for its best day in just under a year, but still wallowed near the eight-year lows hit when Moody&#8217;s cut the firm&#8217;s debt rating to junk a week ago.
