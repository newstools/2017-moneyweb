ANKARA &#8211; South African media and internet giant Naspers will close its Turkish e-commerce and fashion company Markafoni at the end of June, it said on Thursday, citing a challenging economic environment.Global investor enthusiasm for Turkey, which has a growing and young population with a median age of just over 30, has cooled amid rising security and political concerns despite its enviable demographics and growth potential.&#8220;Despite initial success, the business (Markafoni) is not scaling sufficiently to be sustainable, and in a challenging economic environment for this type of business the decision was taken to close,&#8221; Naspers said in a statement. Turkey&#8217;s growing e-commerce market was worth 24.7 billion lira ($6.99 billion) in 2015, accounting for only 2% of total retail revenue, according to the Turkish Informatics Industry Association.Markafoni said that operations would cease on June 30.&#8220;We thank all of you for the support and trust you have shown us since we were established in 2008,&#8221; a statement on its website said.It did not give a reason for the closure, but Turkish media reports said the business has failed to turn a profit.Markafoni representatives were not immediately available for comment.Parent Naspers said the closure was a standalone decision and would have no impact on other Naspers companies and investments in Turkey, including OLX, Letgo, PayU and Delivery Hero.&#8220;We believe that Turkey remains a good growth opportunity for these other businesses, which all continue to gain traction and scale,&#8221; Naspers said.
