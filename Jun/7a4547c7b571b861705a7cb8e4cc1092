CAPE TOWN &#8211; South Africa could see a spike in bad loans as the first recession since 2009 hits millions of chronically indebted consumers struggling to pay back credit totalling R1.7 trillion ($133.19 billion), the National Credit Regulator (NCR) said on Wednesday.Africa&#8217;s most developed economy slipped into recession in the first quarter, compounding a slew of negative economic indicators including sovereign rating downgrades and stubbornly high unemployment.&#8220;Already we&#8217;ve got a lot of accounts, more than a third, that are impaired and the percentages might go up. So we are worried,&#8221; Nomsa Motshegare, the NCR chief executive told Reuters.&#8220;There must be responsible borrowing but also responsible lending,&#8221; she said after briefing parliament where changes to the National Credit Act were being considered to help relieve over-indebted consumers. Motshegare said at the end of December, there were around 24 million active credit consumers, with 40%, or just under 10 million people, having some form of &#8220;impaired record&#8221; of payment.Unbridled lending fuelled a consumer frenzy that lifted growth to an average 5% annually in the period before the 2009 recession, before the government introduced legislation clamping down on irresponsible lending.The National Treasury, which has previously introduced a debt amnesty to assist poor and indebted consumers, said they were considering a number of options, including &#8220;extinguishing&#8221; some or all debt to help people get a fresh start.&#8220;If a person can pay, he or she should pay,&#8221; said Katherine Gibson, senior adviser for market conduct and inclusion at the treasury.Gibson told parliament&#8217;s trade and industry committee that further research was needed to determine the impact of possible debt relief packages, which was expected to heavily impact retailers and microlenders.&#8220;It is expected to heavily impact access to credit and is likely to push desperate people to illegal operators,&#8221; she said.
