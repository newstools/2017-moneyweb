US stocks opened little changed on Thursday as oil prices remained near multi-month lows, undermining efforts by major producers to stabilize the market.US crude traded up 0.45% at $42.71 per barrel. They closed down 1.6% on Wednesday after touching their lowest level since August. Global benchmark Brent was 0.83% higher at $45.19.Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped around 20%, skidding into bear market territory, despite Opec-led efforts to stabilise the market.&#8220;Oil is trying to balance, but I&#8217;m worried that it would continue to head lower,&#8221; said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&amp;K Investment Management. &#8220;I think this a situation where Opec is ceding market share and is no longer able to control prices.&#8221;The S&amp;P energy index, which has lost 14.9% this year, is the worst performing sector, largely underperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 index.At 9:37am ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.32 points, or 0.03%, at 21 403.71, the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.63 points, or 0.07%, at 2 433.98 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 3.89 points, or 0.06%, at 6 230.06.Investors are concerned that the drop in oil prices could affect inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly below the Federal Reserve&#8217;s 2% target, even as the central bank adopts a hawkish tone regarding future rate hikes.&#8220;I&#8217;ve been more worried about deflation. I know (the Fed) wants to normalise, but I think it would be tough to get one more this year and three next year in the face of a flattening yield curve,&#8221; added Clark.A flattening yield curve is often interpreted as a negative economic indicator as it shows concerns about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs.The yield spread between five-year Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds flattened to its narrowest level since December 2007.Economic data on Thursday showed jobless claims for last increased by 3 000 to 241 000, but remain at levels consistent with a tight labor market.The healthcare index was the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&amp;P sectors with a 0.43% rise.Among stocks, Accenture was off 4% after the consulting and outsourcing services provider trimmed its annual revenue forecast.Oracle&#8217;s shares were up about 10% as the business software maker forecast an upbeat current-quarter profit, prompting brokerages to raise price targets.American Airlines was up 3% at $49.93 after the US airline said Qatar Airways had expressed interest in buying a 10% stake.The news lifted shares of other major US airlines such as Delta Air Lines, United Continental and Southwest Airlines, which were up about 1%.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1 444 to 1 046.
