Finance minister Malusi Gigaba has denied he acted unlawfully when granting five members of the Gupta family naturalisation certificates in May 2015 during his time as Minister of Home Affairs.In a statement issued on Tuesday, Gigaba confirmed the authenticity of the letters addressed to the family, which were circulated online by the Economic Freedom Fighters (shown below). &#8220;I have requested the Department of Home Affairs to provide chronological details of how all applications by the Gupta family have been handled by the Department of Home Affairs from the beginning. We have no doubt that the whole process has been handled by the book in terms of our laws,&#8221; said Gigaba.He said it was within his powers to shorten the process of acquiring citizenship for the Gupta family members and that similar courtesies had been extended to prominent businessmen, including executives of multi-nationals, and sports people.The EFF last week filed a criminal complaint against Gigaba over what it says is evidence of corruption in a lucrative government tenders. Minister Gigaba says he feels aggrieved about the sensational nature of the media reports that he considers were unfair and inaccurate at a time when such &#8220;spurious sideshows&#8221; divert the focus of the nation from the serious economic challenges it faces currently.&#8220;I have requested the Department of Home Affairs to provide chronological details of how all applications by the Gupta family have been handled by the Department of Home Affairs from the beginning. We have no doubt that the whole process has been handled by the book in terms of our laws, said Minister Gigaba.The full statement reads as follows: The Minister lawfully approved the application in terms of South African Citizenship Act, 1995 (Act 88 of 1995) that was amended by the South African Citizenship Amendment Act, 2010 (Act No. 17 of 2010)). The Act vests the authority on the Minister of Home Affairs to grant a certificate of naturalisation as a South African citizen to any alien who satisfies requirements for naturalisation.The application was handled in line with the procedure that requires that the Department of Home Affairs submits recommendations to the Minister for consideration.The granting of naturalisation certificates of this nature is not unusual. Similar courtesies have been extended to prominent businessmen, including executives of multi-nationals, and sports people. There is no impropriety on the part of the Minister in relation to how the application in question has been handled.
