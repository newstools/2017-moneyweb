JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Brait reported a hefty 43% fall in full-year net asset value (NAV) on Tuesday, weighed down by unfavourable currency movements and a weak showing at New Look, its British no-frills clothing chain.Brait, which also owns gym chain Virgin Active and British supermarket Iceland Foods, said NAV totalled R39.5 billion ($3.45 billion), or R78.15 per share in the year to end March.That was down from R70 billion, or 136.3 cents a year earlier. NAV is a performance measure for investment companies that reflects the value of underlying assets excluding liabilities.Brait has been under pressure in recent months as a weaker British pound eat into earnings measured in rand while weak consumer demand and tough competition in the UK&#8217; high street has weighed on one of its biggest profit sources, New Look.Brait slashed the carrying value of its New Look, which competes with the River Island and H&amp;M, by about 80% to R7.1 billion.That means New Look&#8217;s contribution to Brait&#8217;s group NAV fell to 15% from about 45% a year earlier.&#8220;The promotion-led market in the UK and certain womenswear product challenges meant New Look had to discount more than planned to maintain inventories at a healthy level, impacting margins,&#8221; Brait said in a statement.($1 = R12.7686)
