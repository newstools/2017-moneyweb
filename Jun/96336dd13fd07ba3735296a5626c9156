JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s ruling African National Congress must put a stop to public spats and unite to avoid handing the advantage to its opponents, President Jacob Zuma said on Friday.&#8220;We must unite and close ranks and find solutions to the challenges we face,&#8221; Zuma told veterans of the ANC&#8217;s military wing. &#8220;We cannot afford anymore self-inflicted pain.&#8221;The ANC has become increasingly divided over Zuma&#8217;s leadership in recent months due to a string of corruption scandals, diminishing public support and economic instability caused partly by a cabinet reshuffle in March.
