Every year, some very rich person pays multiple millions at auction to buy a private lunch with Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s Warren Buffett. This year, the anonymous winning bidder paid $2.68 million. Crazy, right? Those who missed out on the chance to dine with the Oracle of Omaha likely comforted themselves with the thought that such a lunch is just wretched excess it couldn&#8217;t actually be worth $2.7 million. Or could it? A rather creative Deutsche Bank report (PDF) argues that the meal could be a great long-term investment even for the hoi polloi who watch the annual bidding as entertainment. It&#8217;s quite simple when you have fun with the math (and reality). The exercise starts with the average U.S. worker, which the report describes as a 42-year-old with savings of $92,500, earning an annual 7%. (We wish.) By age 65, even if that person contributed no additional money to the pot, it would have swelled to $284,000, after adjusting for inflation, the report claims.&#8220;But when, over dessert, Warren whispers the secret to Berkshire Hathaway s 19 per cent annualised return since inception, the expected pot becomes $3.8 million,&#8221; the report reads. &#8220;Hence the average American should be willing to pay $3.5 million for the lunch.&#8221; Coincidentally, last year&#8217;s auction winner paid $3,456,789.Bottom line: &#8221; If someone with just $92,500 to invest should spend that much, every billionaire hedgie who has dined with Warren has underpaid.&#8221;Whether the hedgies of yore former winner David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital among them got a steal for their millions or not, it&#8217;s all for a good cause. The money goes to the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco charity that serves meals to the homeless, hosts support groups through its women s center for abuse victims, and provides treatment for drug addiction. 2017 Bloomberg
