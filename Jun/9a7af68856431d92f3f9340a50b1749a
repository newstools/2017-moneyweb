Judge Brian Spilg on Monday authorised a warrant for the arrest of former Tigon CEO Gary Porritt after he failed to show in court due to alleged illness.Porritt, who together with fellow Tigon former director Sue Bennett, stands accused of more than 3 000 charges related to the collapse of Tigon in 2002, was allegedly hospitalised on Saturday.The accused who were arrested in 2002 and 2003 respectively managed to delay the start of the trial by four years by bringing a series of applications and appeals. In dealing with one such matter, the Supreme Court of Appeal earlier found they intend to employ every stratagem available to them in order to delay the commencement and thereafter continuation of the trial for as long as they possibly can .When the trial eventually got underway in September last year the accused were unrepresented as they claimed to have run out of money for legal fees. Porritt slowed down the trial through his extremely slow note making and Spilg accommodated him to avoid the risk of him claiming at a later stage that he was not afforded a fair trial.In January the trial ground to a complete standstill when Bennett failed to appear in court citing illness. Spilg issued a warrant for her arrest and launched a full enquiry into her health and her ability to stand trial.The enquiry was stayed last week after a much improved Bennett reached an agreement with the state that the trial would continue with a week s break after every two weeks it sits, to allow her to recharge her batteries .The first witness, former Progressive Systems College (PSC) MD Jack Milne resumed his testimony. PSC s investment fund Progressive Systems College Guaranteed Growth (PSCGG) was underwritten by Tigon and is central to the whole matter.Milne has already served a jail term in connection with the events and last week testified how PSCGG s financial data was fabricated with full knowledge of Porritt and Bennett.The trial was set to continue on Monday morning, but Porritt failed to arrive. A Dr A Mugabi certified that Porritt was admitted on Saturday and was being evaluated for syncope (fainting) and would remain in hospital for three to five days.Spilg subsequently authorised a warrant for Porritt s arrest. He ordered Porritt to show cause on Monday, June 19 of why the warrant should not be issued and his bail revoked.He further ordered Porritt to get a written report from Mugabi or a specialist and forward it to the parties and the court by 14:00 on Thursday. The report should indicate whether he will be able to attend court on Monday, whether any medical condition precludes him to do so and when he will be discharged from hospital.The report should also indicate if he is able to attend on Monday, whether he will be able to participate in proceedings and if not, how long it will be before he will be able to participate again.During his testimony last week, Milne dealt with a draft article the late investigative journalist Deon Basson sent to him in May 2002 prior to publication in Finance Week.Basson s article was based on an interview with Milne and relayed how Milne stated that he would rather close PSCGG and pay a liquidation dividend than disclose the contents of its investment portfolio.According to the article, PSCGG had in the two years prior raised R150 million from 4 000 shareholders. Basson alleged that 90 million of the 109.7 million shares in issue at that stage had been sold without a valid prospectus, in contravention of the Companies Act.He described how PSCGG benchmarked itself agains the PADEFI Index, a weighted average of the South African unit trust industry. Tigon guaranteed that PSCGG would outperform the index and would earn 50% of the growth above the index in return.Basson pointed out that PSCGG failed to have its NAV certified by Grant Thornton Kessel Feinstein (GTKF) every month as promised in the initial prospectus. This in fact happened only once before GTKF resigned as performance surveyors more than a year prior and PSCGG never disclosed it, Basson wrote.Basson described how the PSCGG share register was oddly held at the Tigon head office in Pietermaritzburg and how voting power was apparently concentrated in Milne (61.8%) and Bennett (24.7%).He referred to Milne s claims that PSCGG outperformed the JSE All Share Index, Satrix 40, Dow Jones Industrial Index and Nasdaq and its share value grew by 109% in the year ended May 2002.Basson challenged Milne to have the fund independently audited and pointed out that PSCGG s auditor at the time Simon Hurwitz Inc was widely criticised. Milne responded that he would rather close the company that disclose its share portfolio.In court last week Milne testified that most of Basson s analysis was spot on. He stated that he and the accused were aware that full disclosure would expose their conduct. At the time he had been fabricating PSCGG s NAV for months with Porritt and Bennett s full knowledge, he testified.He further testified that the original prospectus was never based on true facts, but was designed to mislead and deceive investors .The court will resume on Monday June, 19.
