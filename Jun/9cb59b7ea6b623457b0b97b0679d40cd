Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe confirmed to Moneyweb on Tuesday that the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has upheld the Eskom and Nersa appeal against an earlier High Court judgement that set aside an interim tariff increase and called further similar applications into question.This means that Eskom does not need to pay back a portion of the 9.4% additional tariff increase Nersa granted it last year, two further revenue applications totalling more than R40 billion will become live again and the door has opened for Eskom to submit two more that might total a further R20 billion. The increases are based on variances to the assumptions that Nersa based its initial five-year tariff determination (MYPD3) for April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2018 upon. Eskom, for example, used much more diesel during the earlier years of the period and got less revenue as sales were way below forecasts during the whole period. Eskom claims the increased cost and lower revenue after the conclusion of every year through the Regulatory Clearing Account (RCA) mechanism.Moneyweb earlier reported that intensive users in the Eastern Cape succeeded with a procedural challenge to the additional increase Nersa granted Eskom in terms of the RCA mechanism. The same flaws which affected that increase would also affect two further RCA applications and Nersa shelved them pending the SCA ruling.Read: Nersa to consider further Eskom RCA submissionsThis ruling has now been given in favour of Eskom and Nersa and brings alive those shelved applications. The stumbling blocks have now been further removed and Eskom can submit the RCA applications relating to 2016/17 and 2017/18 in due course.This comes against the background of an application for a 20% tariff increase that Eskom is expected to submit within the next week or two.Nersa will have to plot a way forward to deal with all the applications in a way that balances the impact on the consumer.Read: Eskom RCA judgement flawed NersaIt does have the option to implement the RCA determinations over more than one year.Read the full SCA ruling here.More to follow.
