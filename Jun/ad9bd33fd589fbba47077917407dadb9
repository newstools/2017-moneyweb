Facebook s social network now has two billion monthly active users &#8212; about a quarter of the world s population and more than half of the people on the internet.It s the first social network to connect that many people. Google s YouTube recently announced it has 1.5 billion logged-in users a month, while Facebook s Instagram has 700 million and Twitter has 328 million.Facebook is reaching the milestone just a few days after co-founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg declared that simply adding more people to the social network isn t enough. He outlined a new mission for the Menlo Park, California-based company, centered on helping people build strong bonds, in response to isolationist and nationalist movements around the world. We re making progress connecting the world, and now let s bring the world closer together, Zuckerberg said in a post on his Facebook page Tuesday. 2017 Bloomberg
