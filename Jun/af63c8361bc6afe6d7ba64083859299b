JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African construction company Group Five said on Friday its non-executive directors would all resign from the board in July, following pressure from its largest shareholder Allan Gray, which wants to reconstitute the board.Allan Gray, an investment management company, notified Group Five in May of its request to call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to reconstitute the board following a disagreement with it on the future direction of the company.Talks with Allan Gray to try to address its concerns have not been successful, Group Five said.&#8220;Considering the breakdown of negotiations on how to reconstitute the board and the tenor of the relationship with the company&#8217;s most material shareholder, the board acknowledges that it is in the interest of the company that the non-executive directors step down,&#8221; Group Five said in a statement.The five non-executive directors are chairperson Philisiwe Mthethwa, Kalaa Mpinga, Willem Louw, Justin Chinyanta and Vincent Rague.Allan Gray, a fund manager in South Africa with more than 40 billion rand ($3.13 billion) of client assets under its equity fund, has proposed that Michael Upton, former group chief executive, Reitumetse Huntley, Nazeem Martin, Nonyameko Madindi and John Job be appointed as non-executive directors.Mthethwa said the board was concerned about the approach its shareholder has taken and questioned the underlying reasons for its call to reconstitute the board.&#8220;Importantly, we believe that the reconstitution of the Board should not be driven by a single shareholder but that all shareholders should exercise their rights and vote for directors at the EGM whom they believe will best protect the company&#8217;s commercial interests, relationship with critical and commercially relevant stakeholders.&#8221;Six executives and non-executives at Group Five have resigned since February this year, including CEO Eric Vemer.In an emailed response to questions on Monday, Allan Gray&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer and director Andrew Lapping said &#8220;A new non-executive board will be able to propel the company forward.&#8221;&#8220;It is our opinion that it is in the interests of all Group Five stakeholders that the company makes a fresh start. The best way to achieve this is through a refreshed non-executive,&#8221; Lapping told Reuters.Group Five&#8217;s shares were down 0.21 percent to 18.60 rand at 1400.
