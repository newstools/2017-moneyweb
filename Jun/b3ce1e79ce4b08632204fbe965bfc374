National Treasury has confirmed the appointment of Dondo Mogajane as South Africa s new Director General of Finance, scotching rumblings that former Eskom CEO and parliamentary back-bencher Brian Molefe may be deployed to the role.The position was left open following the resignation of Lungisa Fuzile who has served at Treasury for 19 years. He signalled his intention to resign ahead of the axing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Mogojane, who has been acting DG since Fuzile left at the end of April, was previously Head of Public Finance within Treasury. He has been with the department for over ten years. He will be National Treasury&#8217;s 4th DG. Maria Ramos was the first, Lesetja Kganyago was the second and Lungisa Fuzile was the third.Mogojane will play a crucial role in steadying the ship following the axing of Gordhan and the departure of Fuzile and deputy DG Andrew Donaldson who will continue to consult to National Treasury.He will also have a say in the appointment of Donaldson s successor.
