JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African markets fell on Tuesday as Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country entered recession for the first time in eight years, with stocks touching a more than 1-month low.The rand fell more than 1% against the dollar to a session low of 12.8950/dollar after data showed the economy contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017 after shrinking by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.By 1518 GMT, the unit traded at 12.8150/dollar, 0.83% weaker than its close on Monday.The economic contraction was led by weak manufacturing and trade, suggesting high unemployment and stagnant wages were dragging down South Africa&#8217;s long-resilient consumer sector.Read: SA economy back in recession&#8220;This dismal performance was recorded before two international ratings agencies downgraded South Africa&#8217;s foreign currency debt rating to sub-investment grade during early April, which has knocked confidence levels in the economy further and is expected to keep a ceiling on growth,&#8221; said Elize Kruger, an economist at NKC African Economics.S&amp;P Global Ratings in April cut South Africa&#8217;s foreign currency debt to speculative grade, while rival Fitch downgraded the country to &#8220;junk&#8221; for both foreign and local currency debt, after respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan was sacked.Moody&#8217;s, whose Baa2 rating is two notches above &#8220;junk&#8221;, is reviewing South Africa for a possible downgrade.On the equities market, the Johannesburg All-Share index fell 1.17% to 52 251 points, a level last seen April 24, while the benchmark Top-40 index declined 1.19% to 45 889 points.Domestically focused stocks or those that feed off the local economy, including retail and banks, were under renewed pressure following the GDP data.The retail index fell 2.75%, while the banks index declined 3.28%.&#8220;Given that the core of the South African economy (retail, manufacturing, finance) is now extremely weak, it would appear that South Africa is going to struggle to lift its growth rate meaningfully back up to 2% over the next two years,&#8221; said Stanlib chief economist Kevin Lings in a note.Leading the bourse lower, MMI Holdings tumbled 8.22% to R20.65 after posting a drop in new single premium sales for the nine-months ended March.Bucking the trend, gold shares surged 6.93% as weak economic data in the United States reduced expectations of rapid US interest rate rises this year.Government bonds also weakened, with the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 adding 5 basis points to 8.485%.
