JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Treasury has yet to decide whether it will challenge a recommendation by an anti-graft watchdog to change the central bank&#8217;s mandate, a proposal that rocked markets, the deputy finance minister said on Monday.Asked if Treasury thinks the public protector went beyond her mandate with the recommendation, Sfiso Buthelezi said: &#8220;We haven&#8217;t taken a view but as things stand now we are happy that the central bank has exercised its right by taking it for review.&#8221;Both the central bank and parliament said last week they planned to mount legal challenges to the proposal.
