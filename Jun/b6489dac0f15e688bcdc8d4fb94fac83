JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African e-commerce and pay-TV giant Naspers reported a 41% jump annual profit on Friday as strong results from its Chinese money spinner Tencent offset weak performances from its pay-TV and other e-commerce ventures.Founded in 1915, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into a $85 billion multinational with private equity-style investments e-commerce platforms such as auction sites, online retail and e-classifieds.But it owes much of that valuation to its 33% Tencent stake, which is worth about R114 billion, or 20% more than Naspers itself. The discount has prompted some investors to urge Chief Executive Bob van Dyk to find ways to narrow it.Naspers, South Africa&#8217;s biggest company by market value, said core headline earnings totalled $1.8 billion, or 406 cents per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or 298 cents per share, a year earlier.Core headline EPS is Naspers&#8217; main profit measure that strips out non-operational and one-off items.Naspers said its e-commerce division, which excludes Tencent and houses assets such as OLX, the biggest classifieds sites in India and Brazil, widened losses to $682 million from $648 million.&#8220;During the 2018 financial year the group will keep scaling its commerce businesses to drive profitability and cash generation,&#8221; the company said.Naspers has ploughed around $4 billion since 2012 into the business to drive growth mainly in e-commerce platforms and reduce its dependence on Tencent and pay-TV, which thrives in South Africa but faces headwinds elsewhere.Shares in Naspers rose 2.18% to R2 627 rand at 13:55 GMT.
