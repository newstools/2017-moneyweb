South African farmers are expected to reap a record 15.82 tonnes of maize this season after better weather boosted yields, particularly for the staple white maize, a Reuters poll of five traders and analysts showed on Friday.The estimate is 1.4% higher than the latest forecast from the government&#8217;s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) which put the harvest at a record 15.6 million tonnes, double last year&#8217;s output.A drought triggered by an El Nino weather pattern left 2016&#8217;s harvest at just 7.78 million tonnes, but favourable weather since has put this year&#8217;s crop on track to surpass the previous record of 14.656 million tonnes in 1981.The CEC will give its fifth production forecast for the summer maize harvest next Wednesday.The crop is expected to consist of 9.627 million tonnes of white maize, which is mainly used for human consumption, and 6.193 million tonnes of the yellow variety, used mostly for animal feed.&#8220;Farmers are harvesting very large yields especially in the traditional white maize producing areas. Good climatic conditions the past season are the main reason,&#8221; said a trader.The increase in yields has kept prices depressed and industry experts forecast they will remain low for up to two years as exports stall, benefiting the animal feed industry.&#8220;Maize prices will continue to be at low levels for the next two years which will benefit our livestock industry,&#8221; Wessel Lemmer, senior economist at Absa AgriBusiness, told an industry conference in Pretoria.The Johannesburg stock exchange&#8217;s white maize futures contract due in September has fallen 66% from its peak of R5 188 a tonne hit in May last year to close at R1 775 on Friday.
