PRETORIA &#8211; The current account deficit widened to 2.1% of GDP in the first quarter of this year from a deficit of 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the central bank said on Tuesday.Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected a 2.3% deficit for the quarter.The trade surplus was largely unchanged at R57 billion ($4.4 billion), helped by a slight increase in the value of net gold and merchandise exports, the bank said.&#8220;The broadly unchanged trade surplus occurred alongside a widening of the shortfall on the services, income and current transfer account. Consequently, the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments widened,&#8221; the Reserve Bank said in its June quarterly bulletin. ($1 = R12.9875)
