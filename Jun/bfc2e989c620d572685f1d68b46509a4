HARARE &#8211; Zimbabwe&#8217;s economy will grow 2.8% this year, from 0.7% in 2016, due mainly to a bumper maize harvest as the impoverished southern African nation recovers from severe drought, the World Bank said on Wednesday.However, Harare&#8217;s total debt stock would continue to grow, it added in an economic report, putting pressure on long-time president Robert Mugabe&#8217;s government to stick to commitments to bring down fiscal deficits ahead of national elections in 2018.&#8220;While a good harvest is projected to boost GDP in 2017, sustaining robust long-term growth will require addressing underlying fiscal and financial sector imbalance,&#8221; the bank said.
