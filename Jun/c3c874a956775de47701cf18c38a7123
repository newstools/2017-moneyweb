Shares in Barclays Africa Group have come under pressure on Monday after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane proclaimed that government recover R1.12 billion from Absa, which she found to have benefited from an illegal gift .An investigation by the Public Protector found that a series of bailouts granted to Bankorp by the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) between 1986 and 1995 were in breach of the constitution. Bankorp was acquired by Absa, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa Group, in 1992. Mkhwebane said allegations that government and the Sarb improperly failed to recover R3.2 billion owed from Bankorp/Absa because of an illegal gift were substantiated. However, the correct amount of the illegal gift granted was R1.1 billion.The allegations were contained in a report by CIEX, a UK company contracted to the government for 600 000 to investigate and recover public funds misappropriated during the apartheid era.Mkhwebane said government failed to implement the report, after commissioning and paying for it.She said the conduct of government and the Sarb was improper and constituted maladministration, adding that the public was prejudiced by their conduct. The amount given to Bankorp Limited/Absa bank belonged to the people of South Africa. Failure to recover the gift resulted in prejudice to the people of South Africa as public funds could have benefitted the broader society instead of a handful of shareholders of Bankorp Limited/Absa Bank, she said.She has referred the matter to a Special Investigating Unit, which is to reopen and amend a proclamation made by government in 1998 to recover the funds from Absa.Absa maintains that it met all its obligations regarding the loan. It is our firm position that there is no obligation to pay anything to the South African government, it said it a statement.The bank added that it had not yet seen a copy of the report and would consider legal options including seeking a High Court Review after reading it.Shares in Barclays Africa fell 2.6% by 15:00 in Johannesburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read: Rand falls to R13/$ after Public Protector s call to change constitution
