London home sellers cut asking prices for a second time in three months and waning buyer interest hints that the slowdown may continue.Prices dropped 2.4% in June &#8212; the biggest for that month since 2010 &#8212; leaving them down 1.4% from a year earlier, Rightmove said on Monday. Nationally, asking prices slipped 0.4%, pushing the annual gain to the weakest since 2013. In London, buyer activity remains subdued compared to the recent boom years, Rightmove said.Multiple reports are signaling a loss of housing momentum.

London is seeing a sharper slowdown, largely due to weakness in prime locations. For Bloomberg s London real estate tracker, click here. It now seems certain that we will have continuing political uncertainty, which the housing market traditionally dislikes, said Rightmove Director Miles Shipside. With the first fall in June prices for eight years there is no doubt that the lack of stability is a factor. 2017 Bloomberg
