JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party filed a criminal complaint against Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and the state rail company on Friday over what it says is evidence of corruption in a lucrative government tender.A flurry of new allegations of inappropriate collusion between state-owned companies and business interests close to President Jacob Zuma this week have piled pressure on the scandal-plagued leader and emboldened opposition parties.Some of more than 100 000 emails leaked to media show a company owned by the Gupta family, friends of Zuma, allegedly earned R5.3 billion ($410 million) by acting as an intermediary in a tender to build locomotives for state rail firm Transnet.&#8220;We are here because we want to protect the South African purse, which Zuma and his friends have turned into a personal purse,&#8221; EFF head Julius Malema said after filing the complaint at Johannesburg&#8217;s central police station.Gigaba has said he has done nothing wrong. A Gupta family spokesman has said the emails are &#8220;fake news&#8221;. Zuma has not addressed the new allegations but has previously said his relationship with the Guptas does not represent a conflict of interest.The African National Congress (ANC) has become increasingly divided over Zuma&#8217;s leadership in recent months due to a string of corruption scandals, diminishing public support and economic turbulence caused partly by a cabinet reshuffle in March.Zuma, who has survived calls to resign from sections of the ANC and its political allies in recent months, said on Friday the party must put a stop to public spats and unite to avoid handing the advantage to its opponents.&#8220;We must unite and close ranks and find solutions to the challenges we face,&#8221; Zuma told veterans of the ANC&#8217;s military wing. &#8220;We cannot afford anymore self-inflicted pain.&#8221;($1 = R12.9117)
