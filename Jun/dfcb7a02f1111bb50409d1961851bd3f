The Constitutional Court (ConCourt) recently made a judgement on Genesis Medical Scheme s appeal against the Registrar of Medical Schemes and the Council of Medical Schemes. The ruling in favour of Genesis Medical Scheme that funds in medical scheme members personal medical savings accounts (MSA) can be treated as assets of a medical scheme, has huge implications for members of schemes who have benefit options that include a savings account, said the CMS.

He shares his views here.The MSA coinFew can argue that the introduction of what is today known as new generation , or savings-based options was revolutionary. Historically, the South African market was accustomed to traditional options that provided stated benefits for their healthcare needs. For example, a member s option would include a R2 000 dentistry benefit, R1 000 for optometry, four general practitioner (GP) visits and two specialist consultations.But what about those with 20/20 vision or a stellar immune system who are paying for benefits they had, in essence, no true need for? This is a question that ultimately led to the introduction of the savings-based option where members have complete freedom of choice when it comes to their day-to-day healthcare needs.The concept was widely accepted by the market, with most schemes today offering either new generation options only, or a combination of new generation and traditional options.While this industry development was certainly a move in the right direction regarding consumer needs and expectations, it s important to consider the flipside of the new generation coin, which reduced a scheme s cross-subsidisation funds by approximately a third, as personal MSAs were effectively removed from this equationFrom a member behaviour perspective, two major shifts were witnessed. Firstly, the member was suddenly in full control of their day-to-day funds and could easily skip the primary healthcare channel (GPs, clinics or pharmacies) as their first port of call. As a result, members increasingly accessed secondary (specialist) care first and foremost, as opposed to being referred by their primary care provider, a behaviour that s since become the norm.With secondary care charged at a premium, members rapidly deplete funds available in their MSAs, leading to the second change in behaviour: access to secondary care via hospitalisation (tertiary care). In essence, members quickly learned that they are still able to access specialist care if hospitalised, as healthcare expenses related to hospitalisation are paid from the member s risk benefits and not personal MSAs.The ultimate result is ever-increasing healthcare costs, impacting both medical schemes and their members.Adding solvency into the equationContinuously-increasing healthcare costs, combined with the CMS s 25% reserve requirement, represent a heavy cross for medical schemes to bear. Members are not left unscathed either: many a scheme announced far higher than anticipated 2017 contribution increases, as schemes attempted to replenish reserves following considerable healthcare expenditure in 2016.It is, after all, medical schemes responsibility to provide for their members healthcare needs even when faced with unusual spikes in claims while operating as a non-profit and remaining in line with the CMS s 25% reserve requirement.Remember, the 25% reserve requirement was originally conceived as merely part of a far larger infrastructure &#8211; of various factors &#8211; to support the ultimate viability of the medical schemes industry. Unfortunately, many of these other factors have since fallen by the wayside with a scheme s reserve percentage now serving as the near sole indicator of its long-term sustainability.This one-size-fits-all barometer doesn t consider the often complex and interrelated factors that ultimately inform liquidity and sustainability.How the ConCourt ruling s encouraged important conversationsThe ruling s overall and immediate impact is largely limited to how medical schemes present their financial information in future. Previously, MSA funds were recorded as liabilities. Following the ruling, these funds will now be considered assets and can be factored into the calculation of schemes solvency ratios, thus bringing the latter closer to a true reflection of its financial stability.This means all schemes with savings-based options will report an immediately-improved financial position, as MSAs are now factored into the solvency ratio calculations.Of course, the overall impact of the ruling will differ from one scheme to another, depending on the proportion of members who have funds in MSAs. Essentially, the solvency positions of schemes with a significant amount of funds in members MSAs will receive a larger boost than those having a smaller membership on their savings-based options.The cross-subsidisation equation will also return to a pre-MSA scenario, with the total member contribution now regarded a scheme asset versus this amount by default excluding member savings.From a member perspective, the ruling will ensure greater overall security in terms of their scheme s financial health, which will ultimately protect all members through improving solvency levels. Importantly, very little else will change. Members belonging to a savings-based option will continue to have full control over the funds contained in their MSAs and will also continue to have their funds paid out should they move to a different medical scheme or choose a traditional (non-savings) option.The ruling provides a new level of protection against schemes going insolvent, the only situation albeit unlikely where the consequences of the ruling could threaten members access to the funds held in MSAs. However, it stands to reason that the ConCourt s decision makes this scenario far less likely to occur.It can also be debated that member behaviour could be positively impacted, as the perception of MSAs as my money changes back to one of funds managed by the scheme, with members reverting back to primary healthcare as first port of call.The ruling may go a long way to encourage old and new debates about member behaviour and maintaining a balance between year-on-year reserve building to the order of 25%, while remaining affordable and competitive.
