Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Au revoirPresident Donald Trump announced yesterday that he is pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, a decision that was immediately condemned by heads of governments around the world and domestic business leaders. The announcement does not mean the US will immediately exit the pact, as extracting the country from the global agreement will probably take years. On a more immediate basis, withdrawing from the pact subscribed to by about 190 nations means that the US is likely to be seen to be pulling back from its traditional leadership role in global affairs. Jobs dayEconomists estimate that payrolls data will show that the US added 182 000 positions in May, when the numbers are released at 8:30am Eastern Time. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 4.4%, with wage growth slipping to 0.2%. Yesterday&#8217;s ADP Report had an upside surprise, with private payrolls rising 253 000, well ahead of the median forecast of 180 000. Oil dropsA barrel of West Texas Intermediate for July delivery was trading at $46.96 at 5:40am, with the commodity set for its biggest weekly loss in a month as U.S. supply data suggested that Opec&#8217;s efforts to rebalance the market need more time. Within the organization there is pressure too, as data show Iraq&#8217;s oil production hit a 2017 high in the run-up to the deal to extend production cuts. Trump&#8217;s decision to abandon the Paris agreement may seem, at first blush, to be a big win for oil producers, the effect on the market may not amount to much more than symbolism. Markets riseOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1%, while in Japan the Nikkei 225 Stock Average surpassed 20 000 for the first time since December 2015 as the yen slipped against the dollar for a second day. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.6% higher at 5:49am as investors awaited US jobs data. S&amp;P 500 futures were also gaining ground. Corbyn&#8217;s riseJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the British Labour Party, continues to increase his appeal among UK voters ahead of next week&#8217;s election, with his approval rating doubling since April. While the opposition leader, once called a &#8220;mutton-headed old mugwump&#8221; by the UK&#8217;s Foreign Secretary, is still unlikely to win the election, the momentum he is achieving against the struggling Theresa May is keeping markets alert to another British electorate June surprise. A new prime minister is being selected in Ireland today, with Leo Varadkar, the openly gay son of an Indian immigrant, favourite to win the party vote. 2017 Bloomberg
