JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand recovered from recent losses in early trade on Thursday ahead of a Constitutional Court ruling on whether a vote in a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma could be held by a secret ballot.At 0645 GMT, the rand traded at 12.9850 per dollar, 0.73% firmer than its overnight close. &#8220;Pressures on the rand have eased thanks to dollar stability and diminished fears over the fall in the oil price,&#8221; Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns said.&#8220;The ConCourt ruling may reignite some pressure but we are doubtful that it will be enough to push USD/ZAR through, never mind keep it above, the 55-day moving average line at 13.1450.&#8221;The rand was hit by a row this week over central bank independence, triggered by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane&#8217;s call for an end to its obligation to protect the currency.Stocks were set to open slightly lower at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index down 0.13%.In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 dropped 2 basis points to 8.555%.
