JOHANNESBURG &#8211; Ratings agency Fitch affirmed South Africa&#8217;s sub-investment grade rating on Thursday with a stable outlook, warning weak economic growth remained a key risk.Fitch downgraded South Africa to BB+ from BB- on both foreign and local currency debt in early April after a cabinet reshuffle that saw respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan dismissed.&#8220;South Africa&#8217;s ratings are weighed down by low trend GDP growth, sizeable contingent liabilities and deteriorating governance,&#8221; Fitch said in a statement.&#8220;Positively, they are supported by deep local capital markets, a favourable government debt structure and a track record of fairly prudent fiscal and monetary policy.&#8221; Treasury said on Thursday it remains focused on fiscal consolidation and improving economic growth.
