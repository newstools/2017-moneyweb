While youth entrepreneurship initiatives may not be the only answer to solving a global youth unemployment problem, it certainly has proved to be an effective contribution in comparison to what big corporations are adding. It can be argued then that maybe the role of big business is to support the inclusion of young entrepreneurs by developing their skills and abilities.EY Global Job Creation and Youth Entrepreneurship Survey 2015, revealed that 47% of entrepreneurs (and 77% of world-leading entrepreneurs) plan to increase the size of their workforce, compared to 29% of large corporations. The conclusion of this finding is that supporting entrepreneurs to grow their businesses will have an impact on employment rates .The survey also revealed that 65% of the 2 800 young people surveyed, wanted to run their own business at some point in their careers, with 27% wanting to do so immediately and 38% after learning from someone else first. They also found that these ambitions were stronger in developing markets.The reality, however, is that skills transfer and education still plays a vital role when it comes to sustaining a business, which may explain why many entrepreneurs who have been involved in formal employment in the past, often make better entrepreneurs versus those who do so straight after completing high school.Bringing it closer to home, this year s World Economic Forum on Africa in Durban discussed the perpetuating cycle of poverty where more than 50% of South Africa s population is unemployed.Almost ten million people did not have jobs in the first quarter of 2017 and approximately 58% are young people between the ages of the 15-34. Turning South Africa s fast-growing young population into a dividend rather than a burden through future skills education and training is critical in realising this potential. This is likely to be amplified in the coming years due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is characterised by fast-paced technological progress combined with other socio-economic and demographic changes. The WEF Future of Jobs study 2017 highlights that skill demands will change significantly over the next five years, pointing to the importance of aligning education with skills.For example, social entrepreneurship in South Africa is emerging as a blend of for and not-for-profit approaches, which balances the value and trust of social organisations with the efficiencies and profit motive of business.Big business holds the key to ensuring the most effective way of supporting growth of an economy is through the development of young people s abilities to secure employment through differentiated academic journeys that develop entrepreneurial skills. Embedding entrepreneurship at the heart of the education system has the potential to unlock an economic environment where the dreams of millions of young people who want to make an impact and start their own enterprises can be realised. Similarly, through training and skills transfer, youth entrepreneurs can become responsible leaders who project concern for humanity and the earth in the context of accountable business practices.Empowering individuals, breaking cycles of poverty, addressing the country s skills shortages and contributing to national competitiveness through entrepreneurship will ultimately result in economic growth and developmentIt is essential to adopt an integrated approach to entrepreneurship and leadership development whilst making the pre-requisite investment in early childhood development to career. This is especially important in underprivileged communities as it will enable capacity building as well as the right strategic partnerships in civil society.Through the delivery of these synergies and their innovations, we will equip our youth with the right skills they require to not only start their businesses but sustain them in a manner that encourages job creation and makes positive social and economic contributions.Sibani Mngomezulu is executive of corporate affairs at Barloworld.
