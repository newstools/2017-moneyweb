 JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The biggest labour federation Cosatu on Tuesday welcomed recommendations from an anti-graft watchdog that the central bank&#8217;s mandate of maintaining currency and price stability be changed to promote economic growth. &#8220;We have been calling for the nationalisation of the Reserve Bank for decades and we have long argued that the bank is not acting in the interests of the poor majority,&#8221; Cosatu, a key political ally of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), said in a statement.
