Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Fed pathFederal Reserve Bank of Boston president Eric Rosengren said yesterday that the Federal Reserve should hike rates three more times this year, a call that is more hawkish than the &#8220;two-hike&#8221; line that has been held by most other regional presidents this week. Market-implied odds currently show a 20% chance that rates will end the year above 1.5%. Bank of Cleveland president Loretta Mester, Bank of Dallas president Robert Kaplan and New York Fed president William Dudley are all due to speak later today.Brexit workAfter the nine-month hiatus between the vote and the start of negotiations ended yesterday, the work of disentangling the UK from the EU begins. Prime Minister Theresa May has already hit something of a roadblock after the attempt, in her letter, to tie security to trade ran into immediate opposition from European leaders. Analysts are not bearish on this leg of Brexit yet, with BlackRock saying they are long the pound, while Citigroup sees the FTSE 100 rallying to 8 000 by the middle of next year.

German regional inflation numbers are being released throughout the morning, with Saxony data showing a drop to 1.8% from 2.4%.

The European Commission said its index of executive and consumer sentiment for the currency area dipped to 107.9 from 108 in February.
