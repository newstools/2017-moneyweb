South African National Parks (Sanparks) will on April 4 showcase 55 new investment opportunities in ten of its national parks during its first ever investment conference that will be held in Sandton.These include a wide variety of business opportunities for small to large operators like the development of tented camps, lodges and boutique hotels, activities like helicopter and hot air balloon trips, zip-lining and hiking activities and retail kiosks related to the Table Mountain cable car.Sanparks gets only 18% of its operating budget from government, says the organisation s managing executive for tourism development and marketing, Hapiloe Sello.Sixteen years ago Sanparks embarked on a strategy to partner with the private sector for the provision of a variety of products and services that are not Sanpark s core function and since then it has realised R818 million in revenue through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).Private companies have developed infrastructure worth R700 million over the same period. At the end of the concession period such infrastructure is typically transferred to Sanparks at no cost, Sello says.Sanparks is currently running 45 PPPs which gives the private partner access to state property for a specified period and allows it to conduct specified activities in exchange for money.This model, says Sello, transfers risk to the private sector and allows Sanparks to focus on its core function, which is conservation management. We do provide basic accommodation to South Africans at an affordable cost, but providing five-star accommodation demands completely different skills, she says. That would be an example of where Sanparks would partner with the private sector. We are not hoteliers and restaurateurs. The PPP process is followed in accordance with the National Treasury legislation and guidelines. Sello describes it as an extensive tender process during which every bid is properly interrogated .At its first investment conference Sanparks will showcase 55 new investment opportunities in ten national parks, namely Table Mountain National Park, West Coast National Park, Agulhas National Park, Garden Route National Park, Karoo National Park, Addo Elephant National Park, Golden Gate Highland National Park, Groenkloof National Park, Marakele National Park and Kruger National Park.Sello says Sanparks is targeting individual entrepreneurs within their framework of putting local business people first and keeping in mind its transformation agenda, but the organisation also hopes to spark the interest of investment holding companies, funders and fund managers.Some of Sanpark s current partners include big players like integrated tourism group Tourvest, Thebe Tourism, Hoyo Hoyo Hotels and Resorts and the Titswalo Property Group.National Treasury, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and consultancy group Grant Thornton will address potential investors.Among the existing successful concessions are the Table Mountain cable car, the Skukuza airport, the Apostle Battery site overlooking Llandudno and a variety of lodges, restaurants and activities in different national parks, says Sello.The restrictions linked to running a business in a pristine environment are mostly related to waste management, energy efficiency, the aesthetics of new structures and the restriction of noise and light pollution, she says. These are however well defined and not too onerous.
