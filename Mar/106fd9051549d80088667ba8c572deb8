The Constitutional Court on Wednesday asserted its oversight role in the Sassa debacle by instructing the agency and Minister of Social Development, Bathabile Dlamini, to provide urgent answers as to the reasons why the situation had progressed to the point where, just weeks away from the expiry of the invalid contract, we still do not know on what legal basis the grants will be paid. Some of the questions the ConCourt wants answered: Besides getting Sassa and the minister to explain themselves, the court would like to know the exact terms of reference that has been agreed to between Sassa and Cash Paymaster Solutions (CPS). This includes the duration and cost of the new contract that will begin on April 1, as well as whether the agreement is lawful and in compliance with the procurement requirements of the Constitution and applicable legislation.The order also asks if Sassa and/or the minister would have any objections to the independent monitoring of the process required to run a competitive bidding process. This is obviously another mechanism the ConCourt is considering to prevent this whole situation from arising again. In response, minister Dlamini and Sassa said they welcome &#8220;all decisions&#8221; taken by the ConCourt today. This would have included the court&#8217;s decision to deny the Democratic Alliance&#8217;s request to join the hearing, as well considering Freedom Under Law&#8217;s motion to join as an affected party.
