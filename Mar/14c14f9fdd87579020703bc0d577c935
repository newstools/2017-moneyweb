The Competition Commission has defended the lenient administrative penalty imposed on Citibank for its role in an alleged forex trading cartel that is said to have manipulated trade involving the rand, after the bank committed to assisting in further investigations.Following an investigation by the CompCom, which found that several foreign and local banks colluded in trade involving the ZAR/USD currency pair between 2007 and 2013, the case was referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution.As part of the referral, the CompCom recommended that administrative penalties amounting to 10% of the guilty banks turnover in South Africa be imposed.However, the R 69 500 860 settlement it agreed to with Citibank comprises less than 10% of the North American banking group s turnover in South Africa.Read: Citibank to pay R70m in forex probe Settlements in their very nature are designed to entice the respondents to come forward and assist the commission in the prosecution of this complex conduct. So, we tend to not insist on higher penalties during settlements as the benefits that we will get as the commission through settling are huge. We can t insist on 10% given that it will disincentivise anybody who wants to settle, Makgale Mohlala, the CompCom s cartels division manager told the Competition Tribunal at a hearing in Pretoria.He said Citibank has already provided the commission with evidence necessary to prosecute the other banks. It has committed to continue cooperating and will provide evidence and witnesses hearings against other banks accused of forming part of the cartel.Due to a confidentiality agreement, the CompCom could not reveal what percentage of Citibank s annual South African turnover the penalty makes up.It did, however, say that the penalty was determined using the bank s audited financial results as well as the Competition Tribunal s six-step methodology for calculating administrative penalties:Step 1Determination of the affected turnover in the base yearStep 2Calculation of the base amount being that proportion of the affected turnover relied uponStep 3Multiplying the amount obtained in step 2 by the duration of the contraventionStep 4Rounding off the figure obtained in step 3 if it exceeds the cap provided for by section 59(2) of the ActStep 5Considering factors that might mitigate and/or aggravate the amount reached in step 4, by way of a discount or premium expressed as a percentage of that amount that is either subtracted from or added to itStep 6Rounding off this amount if it exceeds the cap provided for in section 59(2) of the ActSource: Competition Commission, Guidelines for the Determination of Administrative Penalties for Prohibited Practices 2014It said that Citibank first approached the CompCom in July 2015 in order to seek leniency or a settlement. As it was not the first bank to seek leniency only one party can be granted leniency a settlement agreement was reached.Moneyweb previously reported that Absa was granted corporate leniency after it came forward as a whistleblower. As such, it is not liable for any penalties.Read: Forex collusion: No penalties sought against Absa The parties are currently awaiting a confirmation of the settlement by the Competition Tribunal, following which Citibank will have 30 days to settle the penalty in full.The CompCom said it has already held a pre-hearing meeting with the other accused of forming part of the cartel. It said some respondents have indication they would file exceptions due on jurisdictional grounds, should they do so the matters will likely be heard in May or June this year.
