The concept of pay for productivity is well documented in microeconomic theory. According to this concept, the labour market is in equilibrium when the marginal cost (extra cost) of employing an additional person is equal to the marginal revenue (extra production) earned by employing that person (assuming diminishing returns to scale on productivity). This suggests that if the marginal revenue is greater than the marginal cost associated with employing an extra person, more employees should be hired. Conversely, if the opposite is true, employees should be released from the company if the marginal cost exceeds the marginal revenue. This theory will be tested against real South African data to see where South Africa is positioned in terms of this equation and what this means for its strategy.The three metrics to be used in this analysis are:Figure 1 (below) is an illustration of the Sarb&#8217;s labour productivity index between Q1 2010 and Q2 2016. Source: SarbOver this period, labour productivity decreased 0.1% (Q1 2010 to Q2 2016). Figure 2, performs a similar analysis on the median annual salary increases between 2010 and 2016. Source: 21st Century Increase Report and Stats SAOverall, the median salary increase was greater than CPI inflation between 2010 and 2016. It is important to note that real earnings are the earnings of employees after inflation has been taken into account or, in other words, the earnings at constant price levels. Figure 1 and Figure 2 suggest that the marginal cost of employing staff (median increases have outstripped CPI) is increasing at a faster rate than the marginal revenue (productivity). In terms of the labour market theory, one would expect that this has had a negative impact on employment between 2010 and 2016, in other words; one would expect the employment stats to erode. Table 3 contains an extract of employment data taken from the Stats SA Quarterly Labour Force Survey (Q1 2010 to Q3 2016).Table 3: Annual Average Change in Employment Statistics 2010 to 2016Classification2010201120122013201420152016OverallEmployed-3.7%4.2%1.9%4.5%7.1%3.9%-0.4%2.5%Formal Sector-2.6%4.0%2.4%4.5%8.1%1.0%0.4%2.5%Informal Sector2.0%1.8%-1.1%5.2%5.9%10.2%-2.5%3.1%Unemployed2.9%2.5%3.3%3.3%7.0%6.5%7.5%4.7%Discouraged Workers31.1%12.9%1.4%0.7%6.6%-4.1%3.5%7.4%*Source: Stats SA QLFS (Q1 2010 to Q3 2016)The final column in table 3 indicates the average annual change in each metric. The number of employed people increased by on average 2.5% per annum, whereas the number of unemployed people increased on average by 4.7% per annum and the number of discouraged workers increased by on average 7.4% per annum between 2010 and 2016.Based on the evidence presented in figure 1, figure 2 and table 3, it would appear that the theory has been supported by the South African example presented above. This means that South Africa is following a strategy that is unsustainable. How to counter the increasing number of unemployed South Africans depends on the objectives of the strategy set out to counteract it. Three scenarios exist:The three strategies indicate that no matter which of them are chosen, there will be those in favour and those that oppose the strategy. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the ruling party to analyse each of these scenarios and take a long-term strategic view when deciding the best course of action for the labour market and hence the South African economy.Bryden Morton, is data manager and Chris Blair is leadership &amp; sustainability, CEO at 21st Century.
