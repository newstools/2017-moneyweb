JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s main opposition leader said on Thursday he plans to bring a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma in parliament after an ally of the ruling ANC confirmed Zuma&#8217;s intention to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.&#8220;At a time when 9 million South Africans are without work and our fragile economy requires leadership and clear policy direction, President Zuma continues to play &#8220;Russian Roulette&#8221; with our economy and the future of our country,&#8221; Mmusi Maimane, leader of the Democratic Alliance said in a statement.
