JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Wednesday he will &#8220;open a new chapter&#8221; of his life if speculation that President Jacob Zuma is set to sack him proves correct.Speaking after the funeral of anti-apartheid icon Ahmed Kathrada, Gordhan told eNCA television: &#8220;You deal with it in a professional way &#8230; and if one is told one&#8217;s services are not required any longer, that&#8217;s the end of one chapter, and we open a new chapter.&#8221;
