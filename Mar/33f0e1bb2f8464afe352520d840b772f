Foreign investors sold a net R123.9 billion in JSE-listed equities in 2016, equal to more than they have cumulatively bought (on a net basis) since around mid-2008. They have been net sellers of local stocks for five of the last ten years (5 of the last 6), according to market statistics published by the JSE.This net outflow trend follows the ongoing weakening of the rand from the R7:$1 level in 2011 to an average of well over R14:$1 in 2016. The actual value traded (in rands) has obviously also soared on the back of the exchange rate. In dollar terms, gross purchases in 2016 were $68.7 billion, barely higher than the $63.8 billion purchased in 2011.Foreign trading on the JSE equity market PurchasesSalesNetR:$ average2016R1011.1bnR1134.8bn(R123.9bn)14,70882015R969.5bnR970485(R1.0bn)12,75072014R784.6bnR771216R13.4bn10,84442013R645.7bnR645833(R0.2bn)9,65022012R525.1bnR528401(R3.4bn)8,20992011R463.0bnR480169(R17.2bn)7,25312010R485.5bnR449085R36.4bn7,32212009R524.5bnR449074R75.4bn8,43712008R587.0bnR641425R54.4bn8,25172007R649.0bnR585769R63.3bn7,0544 The outflow trend has not (yet) turned, with net sales of R16.1 billion in equities in January and a further R9.6 billion in February. The interest rate (bond) market has fared better, with strong inflows in 2016 (R32 billion), despite R6.7 billion in net outflows in December which continued into January (-R5.3 billion). February 2017 saw net purchases of R5.8 billion, for a year-to-date inflow of R441 million.Magnus Heystek, in a column last week (Why foreigners are fleeing our market), offered some thoughts on the reasons why money has been pouring out of the country in recent months . Very simply, he argues, Over the last five years the US dollar-return for foreign investors has been zero . Never mind the fact that the All Share Index has been treading water at around the 50 000 to 52 000 point level since 2014.Market valueThe total market capitalisation of all JSE-listed companies has increased by 138% over the last ten years, from R5.69 trillion in 2008 to R13.58 trillion at the end of 2016. Naspers alone is now valued at just under R1 trillion, and the listing of AB InBev (over R2 trillion and far larger than SABMiller) and Glencore ( R750 billion) in the last five years has helped drive this figure higher. Add to this new equity raised, and you easily make up the bulk of the change in value.Total market cap as at year-end:Capital raisingCompanies have raised R1.168 trillion in fresh equity capital on the JSE in the ten years to end-2016. Nearly half of this total or R519.8 billion was raised in the last three years. This follows from an analysis by Moneyweb of issuer regulation statistics published by the country s largest (and until this year, only) bourse. The categories used by the JSE in collating these statistics are: acquisition of assets, rights issues, via prospectus (IPOs), share incentives or the waiver of pre-emptive rights .Universe shrinkingSet against this backdrop, of course, is the ever-shrinking universe of listed securities and listed companies. In How the JSE has changed over the past decade , it was illustrated how the number of listed companies declined by nearly 10% over the past decade, from 422 to 388 (the picture was certainly worse in the prior decade, where the JSE lost nearly 250 listed companies).Neither of these data sets (number of listed companies or market value) should be looked at in isolation. The market value argument, offered by John Burke in the Financial Markets Journal, doesn t stand up to critical examination when measured in dollar terms (or when read together with the foreign trading picture). Is the JSE a bigger market? Yes and no. And while we have seen some quality companies debut on the bourse, the reality is that investors now have a far smaller investment universe than they did in the past.Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
