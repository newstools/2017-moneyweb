JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s manufacturing output rose 0.8% year-on-year in January, lagging market expectations, after contracting 2% in December, Statistics South Africa said on Tuesday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing volumes would rise by 1.05% year-on-year in January.On a month-on-month basis, factory production fell 0.4% and edged down by 0.4% also in the three months to January compared with the previous three months.Economic and financial conditions have improved since the start of this year, said Nedbank in a statement released on Tuesday. &#8220;There are early signs of a modest pickup in global and domestic demand, but the recovery appears slow, with confidence still highly fragile and credit demand still very weak. Many of the factors that drove inflation higher in 2016 also appear to be reversing. Good summer rains will probably help reduce food prices later this year, while the trade-weighted rand has gained 2.6% since the start of 2017. &#8220;These developments suggest that interest rates have probably peaked. However, we still expect the MPC to err on the side of caution, given the rand s vulnerability to adverse turns in local politics, threats to the country s investment grade status, a faster and steeper pace of US interest rate normalisation and any loss of momentum in the global commodity markets. We expect that the MPC will start easing interest rates only in the second half of the year.&#8221;
