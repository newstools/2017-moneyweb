Nearly 30% of Stuttafords creditors have rejected an amended business rescue plan, that would see an estimated 77% write-off of what they are owed by the department chain.The 159-year-old retailer met with shareholders and creditors on Monday to discuss its future after initial talks degenerated into a standoff between management, shareholders and creditors.A new rescue plan was presented to creditors on Friday evening, after they rejected the initial plan that was published on February 7. Nearly 30% of the company&#8217;s creditors rejected the plan, falling well short of the requisite 75% needed for approval.This leaves Stuttafords with four options: apply for liquidation, submit an amended plan (for the second time), buy creditors&#8217; voting rights, or embark on court action to set aside the votes of creditors. The retailer will publish a revised plan on Tuesday.Stuttafords placed itself into voluntary business rescue in October 28, entering into negotiations with its creditors to buy it time on its financial obligationsCreditors, who are owed R836 million as contained in the business rescue plan drafted by practitioners Neil Miller from Mazars and RS Advisors John Evans include Levi Strauss (R2.2m), L Or al SA (R13.5m), Tommy Hilfiger (R14.6m), Polo (R10.9m), Puma (R2.1m) and many others.Under the initial rescue plan, it was proposed that creditors would be paid 5 cents in the rand and an additional 18 cents in the rand over the next 18 months.The payout to creditors has been reduced to 2 cents in the rand. Creditors get an additional 21 cents in the rand over the next 21 months and a further undisclosed final distribution. Essentially, creditors will be taking a 77% write-off on their debt, which is not secured against Stuttafords assets.There s a catch in qualifying for the additional 21 cents creditors have to continue supplying Stuttafords with merchandise on consignment, or on 120 days credit terms, as it isn&#8217;t in a position to purchase stock for the 2017 winter season. Lawyer at Hogan Lovells Gareth Cremen who, together with his colleague Alex Eliott, represents some of the creditors, says the rescue plan s proposal is prejudicial to smaller suppliers to the benefit of certain shareholders.For example, the retailer&#8217;s key banker Nedbank, which is owed R147 million (reduced to approximately R120 million through the plan), will get most of its money back as its debt is secured.Shareholder ructionsThe retailer&#8217;s management company Vestacor, headed by CEO Robert Amoils, will invest R10.3 million for a 56% stake in the new Stuttafords . This effectively means that the entire shareholding in Stuttafords is worth approximately R15 million and will result in the shareholding of most existing shareholders being diluted to below 15%.Name of shareholders (Before dilution)Name of shareholders (After dilution)Ellerine Brothers26.42%Ellerine Brothers1.02%David Goodman7.20%David Goodman0.28%Loringwood Investments26.42%Loringwood Investments1.02%Daniel Reichenberg2.50%Daniel Reichenberg0.04%The Allan Bruce Rubenstein Family Trust1.92%The Allan Bruce Rubenstein Family Trust0.08%The Rosylen Jacobs Family Trust1.92%The Rosylen Jacobs Family Trust0.08%The Susan Barbara Rubenstein Trust1.92%The Susan Barbara Rubenstein Trust0.08%Dan Orbach Trust1.92%Dan Orbach Trust0.07%Ellaine Orbach Trust1.92%Ellaine Orbach Trust0.07%Louise Orbach Trust1.92%Louise Orbach Trust0.07%The Jafigo Trust5.77%The Jafigo Trust0.23%Vestacor20.14%Vestacor0.76%Stuttafords Stores13.90%Management of Stuttafords International Fashion Company20.08%New buyer (led by Robert Amoils)56.12%Furniture retail family Ellerines Brothers, which owns a 26.42% stake, has accused Stuttafords of not consulting it on the rescue plan before it was submitted to creditors. It has proposed changes of its own: firstly, Amoils stepping down. Ellerines brothers have proposed injecting R12 million in the company for a 76% stake in Stuttafords and have been in contact with other potential buyers.The business rescue plan reveals the retailer&#8217;s monumental losses. In the year to June 2015, it made a loss of R59.8 million as a result of rising operating expenses and finance costs. It extended losses in the year to June 2016, clocking up a loss of R46.5 million.Rescue practitioner John Evans says all stores traded profitably from October to January 2017, recording a gross profit of R82.8 million on the back of total sales of R176.9 million. Amoils, who is Stuttafords fourth CEO in ten years, has repeatedly maintained that the retailer will have a fighting chance after the rescue plan is approved.
