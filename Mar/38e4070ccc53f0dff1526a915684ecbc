If ever South Africans were going to wise up about foreign exchange (forex) opportunities, it is probably this week.The rand &#8211; already one of the most volatile and liquid currencies in the world &#8211; has provided a real roller-coaster ride moving around sharply as the prospect of a recall of the finance minister raises its head.For this reason, I have been particularly interested in identifying platforms that allow me to swiftly move around forex from my main banking partner: Standard Bank. Over the past couple of weeks, I have heard the Standard Bank advert on radio for its Shyft app, which is supposed to make it easy to transact forex in dollars, euros, pounds and Aussie dollars. My primary reason for taking an interest in the app was trying to fund my Saxo Bank stockbroking account without having to wait in the queue at the bank to fill in forms.My main problem with the advert: They neglect to tell you that it is Shyft (with a y ) and it s not easy to find on the app stores if you just type in Standard Bank . However, after standing in a non-moving, Standard Bank (Rosebank branch) queue for an extended period of time, I got motivated to actually find this app. After a bit of searching, I located it and installed it on my iPhone.Sign up is easy and the turnaround time on the verification e-mail and the interface is nice and easy to operate.In terms of functionality, you are ultimately able to to make online purchases using their virtual cards, or pay an international beneficiary (like my Saxo account) and I believe that you can even use the Shyft physical card to swipe or withdraw from an ATM when travelling overseas.The one aspect which momentarily stumped me, was the funding of my Shyft wallet. I had assumed that it would sync with my bank accounts and allow me to simply transfer funds that way.Ultimately, I realised you had to set it up as a beneficiary and then make an internet transfer into your wallet.The transfer was near instantaneous and more importantly, payment into the beneficiary account (Saxo) was funded on the same day. In comparison, when I had funded the Saxo account using the paper method on a Friday, it had taken until Tuesday the following week, for funds to reflect.The interface is easy to understand and you get a live rate for your transactions in the app.In terms of costs, you are charged a flat transaction fee of US$14, GBP10, EUR12 and AUD18 so it s probably not ideal for a lot of smaller transactions, but for a retail investor keen to move some money around, it&#8217;s not the worst rate going.For South Africans, the reality is that currency volatility is a major issue for those whose money is tied up in rands. The ability to move money around, in line with foreign exchange regulations, is going to be a major issue in the coming months and Standard Bank have done nicely to provide a tool that is easy-to-use and fund.
