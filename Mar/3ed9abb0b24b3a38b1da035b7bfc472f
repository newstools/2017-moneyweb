JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The South African Reserve Bank won&#8217;t cut interest rates until early next year, despite falling inflation, as it remains cautious about a US dollar rebound, a Reuters poll forecast on Thursday.All 30 economists surveyed in the poll unanimously predicted the central bank would keep interest rates on hold at 7.0% on March 30.Two economists thought a cut would come as early as May, when the Monetary Policy Committee meets and more see a lower rate as the year progresses.However, a median of all forecasts suggests no change this year and points to a cut in rates to 6.75% either in January or March next year.Johannes Jordaan, of Economic Modelling Solutions, said that given the rand&#8217;s current strength and low inflation, there is a real chance the Bank could lower rates later this year.&#8220;Interest rate increases in the US together with domestic political uncertainty and low economic growth could result in a depreciation in the exchange rate,&#8221; Jordaan said.The dollar has weakened recently as investors worry that US President Donald Trump will have difficulty in delivering most of his economic stimulus plans. However higher rates in the United States could see a much stronger greenback.A Reuters poll last week, taken after the US Federal Reserve lifted rates for the second time in three months, showed Wall Street&#8217;s top banks see two additional rate rises this year, and most expect at least three more in 2018.&#8220;This, together with higher international inflation, could keep inflation close to the upper end of the target band and this can result in the Reserve Bank having a wait-and-see approach,&#8221; said Jordaan.The poll showed inflation was expected to slow from February&#8217;s 6.3% to 5.8% for the year, within the Reserve Bank&#8217;s 3-6% comfort zone, policymakers may favour a rate cut to boost the struggling economy. But the currency remains a wild card.The rand touched its strongest level in nearly 20-months at 12.5150 against the US dollar on Thursday and currently leads a list of 20 emerging market currencies tracked by Reuters since the start of the year.&#8220;In all likelihood, the Sarb could lower rates as early as the first quarter 2018. If it is earlier than that, it&#8217;ll be driven by lower-than-expected deceleration in inflation and a continuously strong rand,&#8221; said Mandla Maleka at Eskom Treasury.Strategists in a recent poll bet the rand&#8217;s rally is probably on its last legs for this year as emerging currencies lose steam and contentious issues in local politics come to the fore.The poll forecast the South African economy will grow 1.1% this year from 0.3% last year and 1.7% in 2018, a healthy bounce but still too weak to make a meaningful contribution to unemployment.The poll compares with a 1.3% government forecast for 2017.
