Listed financial stocks remain on the back foot, amid growing uncertainty over the fate of finance minister Pravin Gordhan.The financial index traded as much as 2% lower shortly after markets opened on Wednesday morning, while the banking index slid more than 3% at one stage during intraday trade.At midday, FirstRand and RMB appeared to be the biggest losers, with shares falling by 3.92% and 3.51% respectively. Shares in Standard Bank declined by 3.30%, with Barclays Africa and Nedbank giving up 9.84% and 0.22% respectively.However, shares in FirstRand, RMB and Standard Bank began trading ex-dividend this morning. Stocks typically open at lower prices on the ex-dividend date, with their valuations having been adjusted to reflect the dividends paid.When adjusted to reflect the impact of shares trading ex-dividend, the declines in the share price of Standard Bank, RMB and FirstRand are in line with their peers, said Adrian Cloete, a portfolio manager at PSG Wealth.He added that the ex-dividend impact on the share prices would be neutral for investors. We can ignore the impact, as investors will be getting a cash dividend in their accounts, he said.Cloete also said the upwards momentum in large international companies and commodity companies listed on the JSE indicates that investors are selling stocks geared toward South Africa-specific returns, in order to buy rand hedge stocks. Banks are a big market capitalisation sector, so it s natural that investors would switch funds from banks to rand hedges. There is a lot of switching going on, but that is to be expected when the currency weakens to the extent that it has, he said.Banks, like retailers and property stocks, are sensitive to movements in the bond yields. The spike in the bond yields &#8211; caused by the confusion as to whether Gordhan will remain finance minister &#8211; has also added to the pressure on banking stocks.Analysts fear that the weak rand may drive inflation up and keep interest rates higher for longer, which will also have a negative impact on banks.The South African Reserve Bank is due to announce a decision on interest rates on Thursday.
