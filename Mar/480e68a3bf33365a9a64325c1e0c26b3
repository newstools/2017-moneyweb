LONDON &#8211; Old Mutual reported a slightly above-forecast 2016 adjusted operating profit of 1.67 billion pounds ($2.03 billion) on Thursday, up 1% from a year earlier, as it prepares to break itself up into four parts.The Anglo-South African financial services group also said it appointed former South African finance minister Trevor Manuel as chairman of its emerging markets business, following a review.Old Mutual is splitting itself up into its four main businesses because it says regulatory change has made it too complex to run the disparate group in its current form.It has said it plans to dual-list its UK asset management and African emerging markets businesses in London and Johannesburg and cut stakes in its US asset management division and South Africa&#8217;s Nedbank. It has already started selling its stake in OM Asset Management (OMAM) down to 51%.It has also said it is open to offers for its businesses.Adjusted operating profit rose 1% in constant currency terms to 1.67 billion pounds, helped by a focus on costs in a volatile political and economic environment, compared with 1.61 billion pounds in a company-supplied consensus forecast.Net client cash flows, excluding asset manager Rogge which Old Mutual sold last year, were 6.4 billion pounds, above a forecast 5.3 billion, and funds under management rose 30% to 395 billion pounds, above a forecast 391 billion.The company reiterated it planned to complete its break-up in 2018.It said its emerging markets business would cut costs and focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Its wealth management business also has a new chairman, Glyn Jones.Its solvency capital ratio fell to 124% from 138% a year earlier, hit by weakness in sterling.A ratio of 100% means an insurer has enough capital to meet underwriting, investment and operational risks.Old Mutual said it would pay a final dividend of 3.39 pence and total dividend of 6.06 pence, down 32% from a year ago.($1 = 0.8222 pounds)
