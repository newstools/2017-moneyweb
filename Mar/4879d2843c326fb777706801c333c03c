After several commentators blamed poor investment returns in 2016 on politically-fuelled volatility &#8211; from Brexit, to the US presidential election outcome and uncertainty in South Africa &#8211; Investec Asset Management says volatility has yet to play out across financial markets. Despite the fact that we like to talk about lots of volatility, it actually hasn t happened yet. Equity volatility is at low points in the last 20 years, political volatility has not manifested itself yet and therefore you have to be careful about how you construct portfolios and how you build them, said Rob Forsyth, a fund manager at Investec Asset Management.Presenting to a packed auditorium during the asset manager&#8217;s annual Taking Stock event, he said its approach to portfolio construction &#8211; especially during periods devoid of growth &#8211; centres around picking quality companies, with hard to replicate competitive advantages, that continually invest in research and development. We love the fact that if you ve got companies with high barriers to entry that invest for the future, they can perpetuate that, he said.As at January 31, the 10 equity holdings of Investec Asset Management s Opportunity and Global Franchise Funds were as follows:Investec Opportunity Fund Holdings as at 31/01/17% of fundBritish American Tobacco5.1%Sasol4.2%Assore3.5%Richemont2.8%Aspen Pharmacare2.1%RMB2.1%Sanlam1.9%Mediclinic1.9%Steinhoff1.8%Tiger Brands1.4%Total26.9%Source: Investec Asset ManagementInvestec Global Franchise FundHoldings as at 31/01/17% of fundJohnson &amp; Johnson6.0%Microsoft5.4%Visa5.4%Nestle5.2%Roche Holdings4.7%Imperial Brands4.7%Reckitt Benckiser4.4%Moody s4.3%Philip Morris International3.9%Verisign3.6%Total47.6%Source: Investec Asset ManagementAccording to Forsyth, the 32 companies held in Investec Asset Management s Global Franchise Fund account for 12% of the cumulative Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) expenditure of all companies. We are actually getting 4x our buck in terms of expenditure that these companies are paying for future development, for future growth. [It is] very difficult to compete against companies that are spending that kind of money, he said.On the domestic front he said Richemont, a cyclical business, is a far better investment than resource companies due to its strong balance sheet, improving returns on tangible capital and its potential to grow its 2% share of the $270 billion global jewellery market. When we build and construct a portfolio, we don t want everything to be going fantastically well at the same time because it means you ve got unintended risk in a portfolio, it means you re taking a one directional bet. Essentially, what we re trying to do is build out diversified risk, he said.Meanwhile Jeremy Gardiner, a director at Investec Asset Management, said 2017 is shaping up to be a better year for investors. You ve got a synchronised global recovery, you ve got the US, China, Japan and the EU all improving. That s great news for us because it s going to drive emerging markets 70% of how you feel depends on whether emerging markets are in favour or not, only 30% is politics, he said. The economic outlook is positive; politics tarnishes it considerably. Economically, we re in a very different space to this time last year and that s why last year when you saw the finance minister being pushed sideways, we collapsed. There was nothing to bring us back. This time, if it happens I suspect that we may actually start recovering within a week simply because the fundamentals are 70% of where the rand goes, he said.He went on to add that the rand is likely to strengthen or weaken by one or two rand against the US dollar in 2017 depending on political interference. Even with political interference, he said the rand is likely to recover quicker than it did at this time last year due to stronger fundamentals.He also said that now may be a good time to take money offshore not only due to rand or emerging market strength but because the pound will be on the back foot while Brexit negotiations continue and as major upcoming elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands may weigh on the euro.In addition, a recovery in commodity prices, a stabilising debt-to-GDP ratio, improved CEO confidence and the breaking of the drought, slowing inflation and the potential for rate cuts bode well for South Africa. We should avoid junk status, assuming the politicians behave, he said.Still the ANC succession debate and a possible cabinet reshuffle, to fill vacant positions, may add some uncertainty.
