PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s economy contracted 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of last year as mining and manufacturing output shrank, the statistics agency said on Tuesday, putting credit ratings at risk.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy faces the risk of being downgraded to junk status owing to weak economic growth after it got a reprieve last year. S&amp;P and Fitch s ratings are one level above junk status, with Moody s two notches above.Poor economic growth has stymied revenue collection, and there is no major turnaround imminent with the Treasury expecting growth of just 1.3% this year, well short of the government&#8217;s target of 5% annual growth.The rand briefly trimmed gains against the dollar, and was trading at 12.9675 at 1100 GMT after touching a session high of 12.9300 earlier.&#8220;The decline was largely driven by lower production in mining and manufacturing. The primary sector is continuing to show a declining trend,&#8221; said Michael Manamela, chief director for national accounts at Statistics South Africa.The mining sector fell 11.5% in the quarter, while manufacturing was down 3.1%.As well as struggling with a volatile political environment, South Africa has been plagued by falling commodity prices and a chronically high unemployment rate.On a year-on-year basis, the economy grew at 0.7% in the fourth quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter.After growing 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to September, the economy shrank by 0.3 percent in the quarter to December, the statistics agency said. The figure lagged the 0.5% growth expected by economists polled by Reuters.The economy grew by 0.3% in 2016 versus 1.3% in 2015.Fiscal consolidation will remain difficult,&#8221; Standard Chartered Bank&#8217;s chief Africa economist Razia Khan said, adding the economy was not growing enough to make a positive difference to key credit metrics.&#8220;Debt ratios still look troubled. Nothing can be taken for granted. South Africa needs greater economic momentum, but it remains unclear what might drive that,&#8221; Khan said.Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said in a note the data fell slightly short of what was expected &#8220;but the worst is now behind us.&#8221; He said underlying figures support the view that growth would pick up faster than most expect in 2017.A survey showed on Friday that private sector activity remained in growth territory for a sixth straight month in February as businesses saw a small rise in new orders, leading them to increase output and employment.
