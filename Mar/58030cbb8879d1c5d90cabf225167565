On the eve of a court hearing that puts the Air Services Licensing Council under the microscope, an anonymous person sent Moneyweb a copy of a summons that raises questions about the functioning of this institution that licenses and controls domestic air services.The High Court in Pretoria will on Friday hear an application by Comair to have a decision by the council to suspend its air services license, reviewed and set aside. Without a valid license Comair would not be allowed to fly.Comair rushed to court in May last year and obtained an interdict that precluded the council from suspending its license until the finalisation of the review application.The council bases its decision on its view that Comair s foreign ownership falls foul of its license conditions, but Comair denies this.On Thursday Moneyweb received a copy of a summons issued late last year and served in February upon Andries Ntjane, a deputy director at the Department of Transport which works closely with the council.According to the document advocate Frans van der Westhuizen, a member of the council since January 2015, is claiming altogether R300 000 in damages from Ntjane in his personal capacity for two instances of alleged defamation. He does not disclose how he arrived at the amount.Ntjane allegedly defamed Van der Westhuizen in two emails that were sent to other members of the five-member council and several transport officials. Copies of the emails are attached to the claim.He allegedly accused Van der Westhuizen in emails dated July 18 and 19 2016, of not preparing properly for the council meetings. Members are paid for preparation time.Van der Westhuizen further complains that the first email gives the impression that he does not assist other members of the Air Services Licensing Council to make decisions on air services license applications but goes behind the back of the other members and wrongfully and illegally makes his own decisions with ulterior motives or influences other members to make decisions based not on the merits of the case, but on ulterior motives.In the document Van der Westhuizen says Ntjane presented him as acting illegally in his decision-making and as such acting outside his mandate&#8230; and thereby prejudicing applicants for air services licenses&#8221;.He further says Ntjane accused him of voting in favour of Comair s application while the majority of council members voted against it.Ntjane allegedly further defamed Van der Westhuizen by accusing him of trying to unduly influence a member of the council s secretariat, doing work in private and secretly&#8221; and trying to influence other members to take decisions that were not based on the merits of the matter.Van der Westhuizen says Ntjane painted him as someone who favours certain operator/applicants and that he wants to prejudice certain operator/applicants for some unknown reason&#8221;.Moneyweb spoke to Ntjane, who indicated that the Department of Transport wanted him to apologise to Van der Westhuizen. But I refused on principle, he said.He questions why Van der Westhuizen recused himself every time the council discussed the Comair matter, while making no declaration of interests, despite being asked repeatedly. Ntjane told Moneyweb that he had given notice that he would defend the claim, but would do so without any assistance from the department. I am standing alone, he said.Moneyweb could not reach Van der Westhuizen for comment.Comair s share price closed unchanged on Thursday at R5.70. Over the last 30 days it has gained 21% and over the last six months almost 73%.
