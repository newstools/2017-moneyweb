In 2013, economist Jac Laubscher said Economic growth is not achieved by agreement, but by creating favourable conditions for it to occur. In today s tense, uncertain climate particularly after the finance minister was called back from National Treasury s investment roadshow overseas &#8211; we could take this to suggest that South Africa s government should be doing much more to create favourable conditions for foreign investment, for employment, for productivity and ultimately for economic growth.But I prefer to consider Laubscher s statement through the view expressed by Max du Preez in his News24 piece: Organised agriculture must take the lead. Du Preez encouraged South Africans to see the private sector, not the state, as the main platform for the economic growth we need in this country.So to lend a meaning to Laubscher s statement that he might not have intended, it s time to shift focus from the state (unless you want to die of hypertension) to the private sector and milk this part of our economy for everything it s worth as a provider of favourable conditions and as a channel for economic growth.This is exactly what the competition authority in South Africa has been doing since its inception: helping the private sector become a level playing field, free from the kind of price and quality manipulation that keeps some firms thriving, while others struggle to enter or make any kind of headway in industry.I think, with our political climate where we are looking more and more to the private sector for development it s become even more important for the competition agencies to continue in this work. Their efforts have seen barriers to entry in many markets come down and they ve created an environment for prices to fall and quality to improve.Here are just a few examples from the impact studies the competition agencies have done: Until 2008, the local price of soda ash was influenced by a long-running international cartel, American Natural Soda Ash Corporation, or Ansac, until the competition agencies shut its local operations down. Soon after, the former cartel members began competing the price of soda ash down, making South Africa the lowest price supplier of the chemical to the world. This run lasted four to five years until import tariffs changed the picture in about 2013. What the commission discovered in its study was that after the cartel ceased, five new companies entered the market in areas that were previously the reserve of the cartel members. They found that the former cartel members expanded their geographic areas of operation, bringing competitive product choices to consumers that were previously limited by the cartel s output. Finally the study also revealed that from mid-2009 to mid-2011, prices of concrete pipes fell by 37% in the Durban area and 27% around Johannesburg &#8211; which is an indication that consumers had been overcharged during the existence of the cartel. The commission s work in the economy has not been haphazard, but has largely been the result of a deliberate and strategic focus on the industries with the greatest potential to deliver economic growth to South Africa: such as food, agro-processing and construction.In 2016 the World Bank recognised these efforts in its own study, which concluded that the competition agency s work had reduced poverty in South Africa by 0.4%.This may not seem like a large number but it should be mentioned that competition policy is not the sharpest tool for poverty reduction. Besides that, every effort counts &#8211; no matter the size.It s becoming more and more clear that if we are to go back to seeing the levels of economic growth we did from around 2000 to 2007, South Africa needs institutions such as the commission and tribunal helping to open up markets and opportunities and to level the playing fields for everyone in South Africa to participate in.Nandi Mokoena is an admitted attorney with 15 years&#8217; experience in the field of competition law.
