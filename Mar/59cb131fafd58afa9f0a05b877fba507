NEW YORK &#8211; Women in the United States plan to use International Women&#8217;s Day on Wednesday to stay off the job and stage demonstrations across the country in an effort to seize on the momentum built from the massive marches held a day after President Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration.On &#8220;A Day Without a Woman,&#8221; those who are able to do so will stay away from work or school, much as immigrants did on February 16 to protest Trump&#8217;s immigration policies.All are part of the series of anti-Trump demonstrations that have taken place since the day after his November 8 election.Objectives of Wednesday&#8217;s events include calling attention to the gender pay gap in whichwomen trail men, and deregulating reproductive rights.&#8220;For years and years, March 8 has been International Women&#8217;s Day, and it has been a happy, happy day, which is fine,&#8221; said Terry O&#8217;Neill, president of the National Organisation for Women. &#8220;But the political climate that we find ourselves in right now requires us to have political power.&#8221;Demonstrations will target a Trump &#8220;gag order&#8221; that bars foreign health providers receiving US funds from raising abortion as an option, O&#8217;Neill said.Early Wednesday morning, Trump urged others via his personal Twitter account to join him in honouring the critical role of women in America and around the world. &#8220;I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy,&#8221; the Republican president wrote (@realDonaldTrump).Trump has been heavily criticised for his inflammatory comments when discussing women, including his boast in a 2005 video about grabbing women by the genitals, and referring to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as a &#8220;nasty woman&#8221; during a presidential debate.American women on average earn 79 cents for every $1 that men make, and African-American and Latina women make even less, O&#8217;Neill said. Since women account for two-thirds of all minimum wage workers, lifting the hourly wage would significantly narrow the pay gap, she said.The minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 at the federal level since 2009, although it is higher in many states.Organisers are attempting to repeat tactics from the Jan. 21 women&#8217;s march on Washington and other cities that came together largely through social media.Women make up 47% of the US civilian labour force. If all of them stayed out of work for the day, it would knock almost $21 billion of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, the liberal leaning Center for American Progress estimated.Organizers, however, realise that many women lack the motivation or cannot afford to take a day off and are urging women to limit their shopping to female-owned businesses or to wear red.Several schools, including at least two sizeable school districts in Virginia and North Carolina, have canceled classes because a large number of teachers requested the day off.Rallies are planned in cities across the country, including Washington, New York, Atlanta, St. Petersburg, Florida, Chicago, San Francisco and Berkeley, California.
