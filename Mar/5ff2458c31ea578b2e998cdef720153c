Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Jobs dayAt 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time the Bureau of Labor statistics will release payrolls data for February. After job gains of 227,000 in January, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the U.S. economy to have added 200,000 positions last month, with annual hourly earnings growth increasing by 2.8 percent. Both ADP and initial jobless claims data released this week have bolstered the case for a Federal Reserve rate hike next week, so only a gigantic surprise today would likely move the dial on those expectations. Impeachment upheldPresident Park Geun-hye of South Korea saw her parliament&#8217;s impeachment upheld by the country&#8217;s highest court, opening the door for her to face jail time amid a corruption probe. The graft investigation, which has also snared Samsung Electronics Co. heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee, is the largest scandal in the nation in decades. Shares on Seoul&#8217;s Kospi index, which have rallied since Park&#8217;s impeachment in December, are likely to continue their gains if history is any guide.

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.5 percent higher at 5:43 a.m. as energy shares reversed losses in previous sessions. U.S. futures were also rising as investors await jobs data. Free tradeEU leaders are taking on President Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8216;America First&#8217; mantra by sending a clear signal that the 28-nation bloc will continue to promote free trade. This week&#8217;s meetings in Brussels are more likely to be dominated by Brexit positioning than free-trade deals, as leaders start to lay out their positions on the coming negotiations. 2017 Bloomberg L.P&nbsp;
