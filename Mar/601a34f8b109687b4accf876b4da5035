On another day of high drama for the country, one characterised by great sadness at the passing of struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada, Pravin Gordhan arrived back from London in the morning and together with his deputy and senior officials from Treasury, found the time to appear in the North Gauteng High Court to see how things were progressing. This was a tour de force. While rumours persist that he has been recalled from Britain ahead of a cabinet reshuffle which would see him ultimately lose his job, there he was, arriving at half past three to sit at the back of court 8E with his team. On the way in he answered the question everyone wanted to know. Yes. He was still the nation s finance minister. Deputy minister Jonas (foreground) and minister Gordhan (background) taking in proceedings at the North Gauteng High Court. What transpired at Luthuli House earlier, where he had been whisked following his arrival at OR Tambo, is pure conjecture. But for a man whose job was a thing of the past &#8211; if reports by ANN7 are to be believed it was strange to see him in court.Needless to say, the whole matter being heard in Pretoria would be moot should Pravin no longer occupy the position of Minister of Finance. It was interesting to observe that someone, who apparently is in the political battle of his life, chose to quietly observe court proceedings, rather than say, rustle up support with members in the alliance.The cool-as-a-cucumber minister also did not use the time to pay his respects to a struggle icon that has tacitly supported him over the last year as matters with the President came to the fore. The optics would suggest its business as usual. Only time will tell.
