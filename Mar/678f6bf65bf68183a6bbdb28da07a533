The financial services goliath FirstRand reported solid earnings on Thursday for the six months ending December 2016. But with earnings growth now in the lower half of its peer group average, largely as a result of self-imposed caution and prudence, is its exceptional rating still justified?FirstRand reported growth in diluted normalised earnings per share of 7% (R2.07 per share) while advancing the interim dividend by 10% to R1.19 per share. Return on equity was slightly lower than the previous corresponding period at 22.9%. The net income after capital charge declined by 8% to R4.12 billion largely due to the increase in the cost of equity.FirstRand s balance sheet remains robust, with its core tier 1 ratio at 14.1% &#8211; far in excess of the regulatory minimum of 6.9%. The group s bad debt charge ticked up from 0.77% to 0.86%, but still remains far below the long-term range of 1%-1.10%.The group derives 56% of revenue from net interest income (NII), and within this lending which grew by 5% accounts for 24% of group revenue. FirstRand CEO Johan Burger, says they took a number of decisions to proceed cautiously with the extension of credit. In uncertain times we want to have a prudent balance sheet. So the lending business reflects exactly what we want to see. When the risk-reward does not make sense, we won t do business. The tepid earnings growth was seen in First National Bank (+3%) and Rand Merchant Bank (+2%) while Wesbank grew by 9%. While RMB s earnings were affected by the absence of private equity realisations, FNB continued to feel the squeeze from the migration of customers from conventional channels (higher fees) to digital channels (lower fees). There is also a lag in being able to adjust the cost base of older systems and infrastructure as clients are phased into digital channels. Long term this is the right strategic decision, says Burger. It s a massive shift away from traditional channels. But we will have to recalibrate the branch costs.

I think the big debate going forward is whether FirstRand still justifies this, says founder of Cast Iron Capital, Greg Saffy. In the past, the group earned the premium on the back of a higher return on equity, superior earnings growth, and less volatility in its earnings, hence the reason why it enjoyed one of the highest book-to-value ratios among its emerging market peers. When it came to volatility of earnings, or the way it managed risk, it conceded no own goals and as a result earnings were a lot smoother. So while the market may think FirstRand still justifies its higher rating because of the higher ROE number, I am saying that more of the premium was based on its superior earnings growth, and I can t see where those are going to come from relative to its peers. With the group continuing to restrain the use of credit levers to drive earnings, Saffy thinks the last option &#8211; cutting costs &#8211; is going to be hard to do. They are not going to open the credit taps, so loan growth will probably remain in the single digits. To drive earnings, they are going to have to cut costs, and it will be hard for them to do this aggressively.
