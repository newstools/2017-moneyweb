The competition for customers among South Africa s retail banks is on, as big banks responding to Capitec s disruptive model are gaining more satisfied customers, says Consulta.In compiling the latest South African Customer Satisfaction Index, the firm found that Capitec customers remain the most satisfied of the retail banks. But its satisfaction levels have dipped for the first time in four years while that of competitors FNB and Nedbank are on the rise.SA Customer Satisfaction Index: Retail BanksMeasured companies20122013201420152016Absa75.772.474.874.374.2Capitec79.081.582.283.883.1FNB79.579.579.379.881.3Nedbank78.674.374.875.677.0Standard Bank77.274.473.773.071.9Source: Consulta The competition is on. The rest of the banks have reacted to their breakfast being stolen [by Capitec]. They ve focused on the lower income market and have created strong value propositions, said Prof Adr Schreuder, chief executive of Consulta.He told Moneyweb Capitec s dip may be due to the pressure exerted on its infrastructure and subsequent service levels, whereas large infrastructure at the big banks may have helped them roll out new offerings with relative ease.Still Capitec achieved the highest net promoter score (NPS) of 53%. NPS measures the likelihood that customers that would recommend the bank to others compared with those that would not. FNB scored 47%, Nedbank 26%, Absa 13% and Standard Bank 7%. The average score across the industry is 25%. Low loyalty scores should be an area of great concern, particularly as brands such as FNB and Capitec market themselves on the ease of switching to their banks, he said.He added that customer expectations are increasing across the industry and that a direct correlation between customer experience and customer satisfaction can influence customer loyalty. In the past banks mainly competed on their product offerings and fees whereas the new service economy demands that banks not only compete on fees but on value as well. Most banks have seen decreased scores of perceived value and South Africa s slow economic growth &#8211; and low increase in disposable income and a net decrease in disposable income [means] most customers expect more from their banks whilst not being willing to pay more for the higher expectation, he said.He said that FNB has done well to manage increased expectations with the launch of several free, value-added services in mid-2016.These services helped FNB recover from a downturn in customer loyalty in 2015 to tie with Capitec, both scoring 75.3. The two banks have the most loyal customers while Standard Bank, with a score of 63.1, seems to have the least loyal customers. Overall customer loyalty has declined over the past three years to 68.7 in 2016.While new products and services may seem like a good way for banks to win over customers, their competitors can quickly erode that advantage. He said banks can gain true long-term advantages over their competitors by investing in staff, systems and complying with regulation such as Treating Customers Fairly. The overall level of complaints registered by local banks is currently at 21.2% compared with the international benchmark of around 10%.Prof Schreuder said the most frequent domestic complaints &#8211; which range from double debits to long queuing times, bank staff availability and a lack of customer feedback can be solved with relative ease. However, local banks appear unable to upscale the simple solutions and prevent similar problems from occurring in future.
