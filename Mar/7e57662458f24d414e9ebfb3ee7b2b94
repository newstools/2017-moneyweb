NASTASSIA ARENDSE: The Grindstone Accelerator is a structured entrepreneurship development programme that assists high-growth, innovation-driven companies to become sustainable and fundable. Throughout this series we ll be sitting down with each of the ten companies selected for the programme. Today we have GJ van Rooyen, who is the chief executive officer of Custos Media Technologies. GJ, thank you so much for your time.GJ VAN ROOYEN: Thank you for having me, it s nice to be in the studio.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Tell us about your story, how did your company get together?GJ VAN ROOYEN: We escaped from academia, I used to be an associate professor at Stellenbosch University, I ran a research division called the Media Lab, where we focused on combining next-generation tech, the emerging tech stuff coming out of engineering and computer science with media applications, new media applications in particular. We became very interested in a newfangled technology called Bitcoin and Blockchain. That was about three or four years ago and at that stage people were thinking of all kinds of financial technology applications of this new protocol and we thought there might be interesting applications in content protection and we came across a way to discover where pirates are in distribution networks and help filmmakers and book publishers and creators of audio books to protect their content. Patented it through the university, started building a proof of concept, got some funding, founded a company, the company spun out from the university and I spun out along with it.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: Wow, so in short what exactly does your company do once I pick up the phone and I get through to you?GJ VAN ROOYEN: If you picked up the phone you are probably a creator of some type of media, you might be a filmmaker, you might be a distributor of eBooks and you are suffering from piracy, somewhere someone is taking your creative content and redistributing it or even selling it without your consent and without you seeing a cent. What we do is embed it s almost like a tracker inside each piece of media, it s something that s completely compatible with any type of playback device or reader but if your recipient s copy of a media file gets lost, it gets pirated and it ends up on the wild internet, we can extremely rapidly pick up that a copy has got lost and where in your network that originated because that very first copy of a pirate movie was overshared by somebody that you know, somebody that you licensed the content to and you probably want to know who that is.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: In the industry or the business that you are in, how popular is it or is it competitive or do you have something that s niche that not a lot of people are onto?GJ VAN ROOYEN: It s fairly niche, the traditional approach to protecting content against piracy is either digital rights management where you buy something on iTunes, on your MacBook and you can only watch that video on that device or in that ecosystem but the problem with digital rights management is it hinders the use of the media by the legitimate recipients, while it doesn t make it particularly more difficult for the dedicated pirate to capture the content and to redistribute it. We fit in a little bit beyond digital rights management, where we embed our tracker at point of distribution and if it leaks we tell you who that original infringer is and that s something you can t do with the usual digital rights management.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: If you could have one particular person or an organisation listening to this particular interview who would it be?GJ VAN ROOYEN: Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, is he a regular Moneyweb listener?NASTASSIA ARENDSE: [Laughing]GJ VAN ROOYEN: In a little bit more seriousness, it s anyone in the media industry who s involved in the creation or distribution of content, especially video media because film, television entertainment, training material is seeing an enormous upswing in piracy and we think there is an enormously underserved need in the market at the moment to protect this creative content. So it s aimed at listeners who are interested in protecting media.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: How do we start that conversation with you, do you have a website or LinkedIn page, how do people get more information and then reach out?GJ VAN ROOYEN: If you Google Custos Media that s the best way to get to our webpage www.custostech.com and all our contact details are on there.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: How did you know that you guys were on the right track? A lot of people come up with many different ideas for businesses or something that you want to run with but what was there that said we re on the right track with this idea, it s working out?GJ VAN ROOYEN: It s a difficult question because, per definition, being a start-up we don t know we re on the right track. It&#8217;s new technology, it s risky technology with an unproven business hypothesis that we re trying to find a sustainable business behind what we re doing and we re certainly not there yet. Along the way there are many indicators that there might be something that could be a successful business. So I think early on for us was coming up with the invention, being able to very rapidly patent it through a very efficient technology transfer office at Stellenbosch University and going through that first process of vetting that you do via the patenting process, vetting the idea against the industry leaders, again the university networks were very useful, pulling in experts in the media industry to hear us out and give feedback on what we re doing. The next stage was actually getting that first bit of funding, we are extremely grateful to the Technology Innovation Agency that gave us very early seed funding while this was just a rough idea we had. On the back of that we could really go and test the idea against the market, get our first pilot customers and that, of course, is the strong indicator, if someone is willing to put down money to buy what you are offering then you should go and explore further.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: There are many accelerator programmes out there, what particularly attracted you to the Grindstone one?GJ VAN ROOYEN: I think Grindstone is actually quite unique, most accelerators, especially in South Africa, focus on idea to business stage acceleration, helping entrepreneurs to figure out whether their idea has market value, to build that business plan, to get out there, to pitch for funding and get that first momentum into the market. Grindstone is focused on a later stage of the business, so it s intended for companies that have proven some market traction, in other words you are already doing business, you already showed that you can get a basic company running and you can get the product out there in the hands of, hopefully, grateful clients but focusing on building the company to one that can operate internationally. Grindstone talks about exit readiness that at some point you need to start thinking about whether you are building a lifestyle business that s just going to give you a steady income for a long time or whether you are going to build something global and that likely means considering acquisition or some type of liquidity event later in the business s lifetime. Grindstone helps you to really grow up as a business, grow out of your baby shoes as a start-up and learn how to operate as a big company with the right types of governance.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: If you could have one piece of advice that you could share with other entrepreneurs what would it be?GJ VAN ROOYEN: That s also a trick question because, when it comes to start-ups, there really aren t rules, you can t give someone a formula and say this is my advice for making things work. I suppose the best I can offer is to continuously be learning and to always assume that you are doing something wrong and that the next person giving you criticism or giving you praise is feeding back on whether that hypothesis, that idea, that you re working with is worthwhile. So I d say be humble in the way you think about things and always consider somebody s opinion.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: We ll have to leave it there, thank you so much for your time.GJ VAN ROOYEN: Thank you, Nastassia.NASTASSIA ARENDSE: That was GJ van Rooyen, he s the chief executive officer at Custos Media Technologies.
