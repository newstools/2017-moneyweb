The Nova Property Group is considering the listing of some properties within the group in an effort to repay the holders of the debentures related to these properties.In a cryptic communiqu distributed to Nova debenture holders this week, the Nova board states that it has been working during the recent past, and has progressed well, in the process of investigating and considering alternatives in regard to a possible process of procuring the listing on a stock exchange of certain of the group s properties .The statement further states that this listing would enable relevant debenture holders to receive payment in the form of cash and/or listed tradable shares, empowering individuals to manage their own capital .Apart from these two sentences in the communiqu , no further details were released regarding this potential listing. Dominique Haese, Nova s CEO, did not respond to e-mailed questions sent by Moneyweb for further information.The announcement raises several questions as to how and which properties will be selected and how such a listing would affect the shareholding of the directors who have received a collective stake of 87% in Nova for free when the entity was formed.Repayment of debentures The board also announced that the full investment capital of the Nova debentures linked to the Silverwater Crossing and Magalieskruin developments would be repaid. Full details of these repayments will be sent to debenture holders in April.The investment value for Silverwater Crossing is listed in the original repayment schedule as R75 million and should have been repaid in 2015. The value of the Magalieskruin debentures is R29.9 million and repayment was scheduled for 2017.These latest repayments mean that debentures linked to five former Sharemax developments have been repaid. The others being Tarentaal, Centurion Hazel and The Village Mall, which were repaid between 2013 and 2015.Haese also did not respond to questions related to these debenture payments and how Nova acquired the cash to repay these amounts. At the end of February 2016 Nova had cash resources of R42 million, while the business has not been able to show a positive operational cash flow since 2012.Haese also did not respond to a question regarding whether Nova sold any properties in its 2017 financial year, which ended last month. These financial statements have not been published.The Villa Retail Park and Zambezi MallThe Nova board did not provide information regarding any individual development as it has done through previous communiqu s to debenture and shareholders, apart from a brief update on the status of the ongoing litigation related to The Villa and Zambezi developments and the developer Capicol.The board said the cases are now ready for a hearing, which would reveal the merits of the actual claims of the parties against one another.No information related to Moneyweb investigationThe communiqu did not provide any insights into the board s position relating to several Moneyweb articles that raised questions as to the level of corporate governance within the group. These articles relate to the apparent over-valuation of the Villa, and an acknowledgement by Haese that Nova fought Moneyweb in various courts for more than three years to muzzle the publication from writing articles about developments at Nova to allow the board to access external funding.There is also no mention of an investigation by Nova s auditor, BDO, into Nova s financial affairs stretching back to 2012. BDO initiated this detailed investigation after Moneyweb submitted a range of questions to the auditing firm in November last year. This investigation has been ongoing for more than four months.Nova has previously suspended correspondence with Moneyweb. The response below was sent to Moneyweb in November last year.Dear Mr van Niekerk,It is regrettable that our efforts in engaging Moneyweb openly, constructively and in a bona vide fashion has not been reciprocated. In response Moneyweb has chosen to publish articles without prior reference to us, and in breach of your undertaking to allow us to see and comment on the articles first, which articles twist the facts, articulate a number of inaccuracies and untruths and seek to slander and defame the Nova Group and its directorate. We are considering our position and our rights in this regard are reserved.It has become clear to us that any information that is provided by us to Moneyweb, will be twisted and used out of context for the purpose of further negative reporting of and concerning the Nova Group and its directorate and given that no further productive purpose would be served in engaging with Moneyweb, the Nova Group has decided to break off all forms of communication with Moneyweb. We will accordingly no longer respond to questions Moneyweb pose to us, requests for commentary on proposed articles or for that matter to any articles that Moneyweb might publish, subject of course to a reservation of the right to deal with any matter Moneyweb might publish, in a court of law.Please ensure, should you elect to publish anything further regarding the Nova Group and any of its functionaries, that you include in such publication our above position, verbatim.Yours faithfully,Dominique HaeseCEO Nova Property Group
