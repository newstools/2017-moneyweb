JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The leader of South Africa&#8217;s opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said on Friday the ultra-left party wanted a no confidence vote in parliament against President Jacob Zuma after he roiled markets by sacking Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Zuma&#8217;s ruling African National Congress has almost two thirds of the seats in parliament and similar motions have failed in the past. But EFF leader Julius Malema told a televised news conference that it was not a waste of time to try because the country was in crisis.
