JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African mobile phone operator MTN Group has limited room to increase its debt levels, rating agency Moody&#8217;s said on Monday, citing lack of dividend flow from Nigeria &#8211; its biggest market.&#8220;Financial flexibility could be restored should MTN be able to begin repatriating dividends from its Nigerian operations, however there is uncertainty over timing,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said.
