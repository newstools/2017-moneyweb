Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Trump&#8217;s speechIn his first address to Congress, President Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone, urging Americans to set aside conflict. The speech, however, was short on the policy details that some investors were hoping for, with the president opting for broad promises &#8221;I am going to bring back millions of jobs&#8221; rather than specifics. While US stock futures pared their gains slightly while Trump was on his feet, markets were generally unmoved by the rhetoric. March hikeMarket bets of a rate increase this month jumped after speeches from Federal Reserve officials signaled a greater willingness to tighten monetary policy. San Francisco Fed president John Williams said he expects an interest-rate increase to receive serious consideration at the March 14-15 FOMC meeting. Evercore ISI have switched their call for the next rate increase to March, from May, citing comments from New York Fed president William Dudley as the reason for the change. The dollar is rallying on the increasing March speculation. PMI dayChina s official factory gauge climbed to 51.6 in February.
