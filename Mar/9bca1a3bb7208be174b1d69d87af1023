Wall Street ended mixed after a choppy session on Wednesday as investors focused on President Donald Trump&#8217;s struggle to push through a healthcare bill and snapped up stocks after a steep drop the day before.U.S. stocks in the previous session had suffered their worst day since before Trump&#8217;s election as investors worried that the president&#8217;s difficulty in overhauling healthcare was a sign he would also face trouble pushing through promised corporate tax cuts that have been behind the market &#8216;s record-breaking rally since November.Stocks fell early in the day but later moved higher. Apple rose 1.7% and provided the biggest boost to the three major indexes.&#8220;Investors with a lot of cash used yesterday&#8217;s downturn and the morning&#8217;s weakness today as a buying opportunity,&#8221; said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz &amp; Associates in Toledo, Ohio.Trump and Republican lawmakers appeared to be losing the support they need for controversial healthcare legislation scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Losing or delaying the vote would bruise investors&#8217; confidence in Trump&#8217;s legislative ability and his ability to keep his big promises to business.&#8220;If that happens, you could see a little bit of volatility in the market ,&#8221; said David Schiegoleit, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Reserve in Los Angeles.The Dow was weighed down by a 7.05-percent fall in Nike after the world&#8217;s largest footwear maker missed quarterly revenue estimates.Oil prices touched four-month lows after data showed U.S. crude inventories rising faster than expected.The S&amp;P 500 has gained 10% since the election, spurred mainly by Trump&#8217;s agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, but high valuations remain a concern.The benchmark index is trading at about 18 times expected earnings compared to a 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.03% to end at 20,661.3 points, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.19% to 2,348.45.The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48% to 5,821.64.Seven of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors rose, with the technology index&#8217;s 0.8% gain leading the advancers.The financial sector, which on Tuesday suffered its worst daily drop since June, lost another 0.2%.Snap Inc jumped 9%.
