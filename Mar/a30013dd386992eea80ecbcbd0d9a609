PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s outgoing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Friday an intelligence report President Jacob Zuma used as justification to fire him was &#8220;absolute nonsense&#8221;.During a televised press conference in Pretoria on Friday that he had been &#8220;sickened&#8221; by allegations that he had secret meetings to undermine the government during an investor roadshow abroad.Gordhan completely dismissed the intelligence report that President Zuma presented as evidence that he and Jonas were having secret meetings to undermine the country.&#8220;This allegation sickens me. I have been an activist all my life. Nothing has to be manufactured to undermine us in order to have a basis on which to terminate our service. All you have to do is tell us you don&#8217;t want us and we will stop,&#8221; Gordhan said in response to the lies and rumors he was subjected to by Gupta owned Ann7.Gordhan then turned to Jonas, and thanked him for the courage in standing up and telling the world he had been offered a bag of cash by the Guptas to become Finance Minister.Watch: Jonas says SA belongs to everyone.Jonas: it&#39;s an important time for SA. Events in the country is contrary to the dream of country. Wake up and smell the coffee.&mdash; Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) March 31, 2017#Jonas: if you look at events in SA in the last couple of years, there are patterns of particular interests being protected.&mdash; Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) March 31, 2017#Jonas: State resources have been diverted for personal gain.&mdash; Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) March 31, 2017#Gordhan: a democracy can only work if citizens are informed &amp; if citizens can question us.&mdash; Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) March 31, 2017#Jonas: if decisions [of governance] are made by external forces, then it questions fundamentals of our democracy.&mdash; Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) March 31, 2017#Gordhan on what citizens should now do: the public should organize. Fragmented voices don&#39;t have weight. But organized ones do.&mdash; Ray Mahlaka (@RayMahlaka) March 31, 2017#Gordhan on how he will vote on a no confidence vote in Zuma &#8211; I will be guided by my conscience.
