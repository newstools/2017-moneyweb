CAPE TOWN &#8211; South African authorities have been asked to appear at the International Criminal Court (ICC) on April 7 over the failure to arrest Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir during a visit two years ago, a senior official said on Wednesday.Ayesha Johaar, the acting chief state law adviser, said Pretoria was asked to appear at the Hague-based court for failing to comply with a cooperation request from the tribunal, contrary to the provisions of the treaty establishing the court and which came into force in 2002.&#8220;It concerns an order of non-compliance by South Africa as a member state of the ICC and Sudan&#8217;s president,&#8221; she said.Pretoria announced its intention to leave the ICC in 2015 after the tribunal criticized it for disregarding an order to arrest Al-Bashir, who is accused of genocide and war crimes. Bashir has denied the accusations.South Africa&#8217;s High Court last month blocked the government&#8217;s attempt to withdraw from the ICC.But Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the government would press ahead with withdrawing from the Hague-based tribunal, noting that the ruling was based largely on procedure &#8211; that the decision to pull out did not pass first through parliament.To comply with part of the court order, Pretoria has formally revoked its withdrawal from the ICC.
