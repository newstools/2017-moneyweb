JOHANNESBURG A Moneyweb reader was recently informed that the tax relief he enjoyed on a portion of his pension, due to work abroad, would be revoked following a change to tax legislation. I am a pensioner of 20 years and have enjoyed tax relief on almost 50% of my pension following service outside South Africa. With just 30 days notice I was advised that this tax relief would be discontinued from March 1 2017 due to new government legislation, he says. I think it is grossly unfair to do this to existing pensioners who have no opportunity to compensate for the loss of income. Currently employed people who were looking forward to such relief are in a position to work a little longer or make other plans, but existing pensioners just have to suffer a massive reduction in monthly income. Retired South African tax residents who worked abroad for a part of their careers (but continued to contribute to a South African retirement fund) will likely share his sentiment as changes to the foreign service exemption on retirement benefits from a South African retirement fund could see their pensions reduce substantially as a result of a higher tax burden.The issue has particular significance for affected people who have been in retirement for numerous years and who have based their drawdown decisions in a living annuity on cash-flow projections that assumed the portion of their pension related to services rendered abroad would be exempt from South African income tax.Unlike recent retirement reform legislation where vested rights were protected, the change effectively applies retrospectively.Jaco la Grange, an associate director in the Global Employer Services division of Deloitte Tax, explains that the change follows a recent legislative amendment to only exempt the portion of the pension received for foreign services where the retirement fund is a foreign fund.Previously the exemption also applied to local retirement funds, although it seems that this was never National Treasury s intention.Beatrie Gouws, associate director for Global Mobility Services and Employment Tax Advisory at KPMG, says the amendment affects South African tax residents who have spent a part of their careers working abroad, but who continued to contribute to the South African retirement funds of their employers.Prior to March 1 2017, these individuals only paid tax in South Africa on the portion of their retirement income related to service in South Africa, she adds.Gouws says she is aware of individuals who have worked abroad for 20 years, while contributing to the South African-based retirement fund of their employers. They would now like to retire in South Africa but because they will become South African tax residents when they do and will lose the foreign service exemption on their retirement benefits, they effectively can t.While they remain non-South African tax residents, the legislative change won t have any impact. South African tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income, whilst non-South African tax residents are only taxed on their income from a South African source.Someone whose career spanned 22 years of which 20 were spent working abroad and two in South Africa and who has contributed to a South African pension fund during that time, will pay tax in South Africa on a 2/22 portion of the lump sum and retirement annuity if she decides to remain abroad and does not change her non-South African tax resident status. However, if she decides to retire in South Africa, and becomes a South African tax resident, she will pay tax on the full lump sum and annuity amount, she says.There is limited relief available for tax-free non-deductible contributions, but this relief is usually limited to the capital contributions made by the employee in respect of which they did not qualify for a deduction, she adds.Several efforts to obtain comment from Treasury on the matter were unsuccessful.However, its final response document on the amendment bills (see page 16), rejected criticism that the legislative change would lead to financial hardship for pensioners who were reliant on their pension as their only source of income. The nominal value of contributions made to a local retirement fund for services rendered outside of the Republic will remain exempt from tax if the taxpayer did not receive a deduction in respect of those contributions. This amendment will ensure that we maintain the principle of horizontal equity, taxpayers in the same situation with similar levels of income should be treated and taxed in the same way, it said.
