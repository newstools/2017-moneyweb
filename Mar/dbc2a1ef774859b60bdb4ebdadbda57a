On the face of it, there are only three reasons one would upgrade to a private banking account: the status or prestige of flashing a black/titanium card, the convenience of having an actual dedicated private banker (in other words, personalised service) and access to airport lounges.Status is important, especially among younger customers who tend to be enamoured by the idea of a black credit card, but who should probably not be paying upwards of R300 a month for a bank account. Banks have slowly dropped salary requirements for these types of accounts, and even if they still exist in marketing material, they are quietly waived.But, aside from the travel benefits (we ll get there in a moment), a dedicated private banker who owns your banking and who you can contact for any request or problem is probably the main reason customers choose private banking. Banks have figured out how to scale the idea of relationship banking , an anachronism from a bygone era.Comparing the offerings from the different banks on these two vectors is difficult. Especially since price surely doesn t enter the equation. Monthly fees (for bundled accounts) hover in the R400 range: from R325 to R465 across the eight options. Service is highly subjective and, at this level, is generally superior to what you d endure in branches and call centres. Your dedicated banker is shared across hundreds of customers. Plus, is there really any difference in prestige between one private bank account and another?One could argue that the only useful comparison is on the actual utility derived from the bundled airport lounge access. Bidvest Premier lounges have long been the status quo in South Africa and access is bundled with almost all private bank accounts. The Slow Lounge, developed by Comair in partnership with RMB/FNB, upended the market and has been a firm differentiator for the FirstRand Group s private banking offerings. However, with the direct link to the group s eBucks rewards programme, visits can be limited. Investec cardholders are able to access SAA lounges at no charge.AbsaBidvest Premier: No charge DragonPass (inherited from Barclays, and similar to the Priority Pass programme, with access to over 800 lounges worldwide): First six visits a year free, thereafter R160 (domestic/R300 (international)FNB Private ClientsSlow Lounge: 6/12/36/48 unlimited visits per calendar year, dependent on eBucks Reward LevelFNB Private Wealth (effectively what we know as RMB Private Banking, but with an FNB logo): Slow Lounge or Bidvest Premier: 12/24/48 unlimited visits per calendar year, dependent on eBucks Reward LevelPriority Pass international lounge visits: 0-12 per year, dependent on eBucks Reward LevelInvestecBidvest Premier: No chargeSAA Lounges: No chargeNedbankBidvest Premier: No chargeRMB Private BankingSlow Lounge or Bidvest Premier: 12/24/48 unlimited visits per calendar year, dependent on eBucks Reward LevelPriority Pass international lounge visits: 0-12 per year, dependent on eBucks Reward LevelStandard Bank: Bidvest Premier + selected other lounges (including over 600 worldwide): 15 free visits per quarter, provided minimum of R15 000 is spent per quarter on Diners Club cardIf you want a decent level of access to Slow Lounges, you ll need to (get your banker to) figure out how eBucks rewards levels work and expend effort to maintain these. Many would argue that these lounges simply aren t comparable to the Premier lounges, so the effort is likely worth it. For frequent domestic travellers who aren t keen to worry about rewards levels, Investec s account is probably the best value for money (even though it s the most expensive) because of the SAA lounge access. Outside of lounge access, most private banking accounts offer some sort of travel (and lifestyle ) concierge service too.Per-transaction pricing on many of these private banking accounts is certainly strange, with Absa and Standard Bank somehow intent on charging over R1 per prepaid airtime top-up! Nedbank and Standard also charge a monthly fee for an overdraft facility, despite these being so-called bundled accounts. Some even charge for replacement cards! Investec, given its lack of a branch and ATM footprint (it has partnered with Absa), offers the most transactions at no charge . At R300-plus per month for private banking accounts, surely the banks could bundle any and all transactions and stop with the absurd ad-hoc charges?AbsaFNBInvestecExcecllerPrivate ClientsPrivate WealthPrivate Banking PlatinumNo clear requirementR750,000 p.a.R1.5 million p.a.No clear requirementMonthly feeR399R365R4193R465Monthly fee to link to rewards programmeIncludedIncludedIncludedIncludedMonthly fee for credit cardIncludedIncludedIncludedIncludedMonthly fee for overdraftIncludedIncludedIncludedIncludedCash withdrawal (Own ATM)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeN/ACash withdrawal (Other ATM)No chargeR7 + R1.85/R100No chargeNo chargeCash withdrawal (Point of Sale)R3,95No chargeNo chargeN/ACash deposit (Automated deposit own ATM)No chargeFree up to R20,000Free up to R20,000N/APurchase/Swipe (Point of Sale)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeAccount payment (Own ATM)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeN/AAccount payment (online/mobile)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeInter-account transfer (electronic)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeInternal debit orderNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeExternal debit orderNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeCash send (ATM)No chargeR9,95No chargeR25Cash send (online/mobile)R7,95 + R1,35/R100R9,95No chargeR25Balance enquiry (Own ATM)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeN/APrepaid airtime top-up (electronic channels)R1,15No chargeNo chargeNo chargeDeclined transaction (insufficient funds)R5,50R8,50 (free at ATM)No chargeNo chargeDishonoured/returned paymentR501R552No chargeR130Debit card replacementR120No chargeNo chargeNo charge41 First 3 per 12 months, thereafter R1502 First 3 per 12 months, thereafter R1453 Rebate if balance of over R100,000 is maintained4 R210 if card is replaced more than once in two-year cycleNedbankRMBStandard BankPrivate Wealth PlatinumPrivate Banking (Bundled)Private BankingSignature BankingR1.5 million p.a.R1.5 million p.a.R696,000 p.a.R1.1 million p.a.Monthly feeR384R4196R325R425Monthly fee to link to rewards programmeIncludedIncludedR20R20Monthly fee for credit cardIncludedIncludedDiners Club includedDiners Club + World Citizen Mastercard includedMonthly fee for overdraftR45IncludedR68,40R68,40Cash withdrawal (Own ATM)No chargeNo charge8 per month, thereafter R1,80/R1008 per month, thereafter R1,80/R100Cash withdrawal (Other ATM)R11,50 + R1,40/R100No chargeR6,70 + R1,80/R100R6,70 + R1,80/R100Cash withdrawal (Point of Sale)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeCash deposit (Automated deposit own ATM)No chargeFree up to R20,0003 per month, thereafter R1,80/R1003 per month, thereafter R1,80/R100Purchase/Swipe (Point of Sale)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeAccount payment (Own ATM)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeAccount payment (online/mobile)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeInter-account transfer (electronic)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeInternal debit orderNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeExternal debit orderNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargeCash send (ATM)R6 (R14 over R1000)No chargeR9,957R9,957Cash send (online/mobile)R6 (R14 over R1000)No chargeR9,957R9,957Balance enquiry (Own ATM)No chargeNo chargeNo chargeNo chargePrepaid airtime top-up (electronic channels)No chargeNo chargeR1,10R1,10Declined transaction (insufficient funds)R5No chargeR7,90R7,90Dishonoured/returned paymentR1105No chargeR115R115Debit card replacementNo chargeNo chargeR130R1305 First 3 per 12 months, thereafter R1406 Rebate if balance of over R100 000 is maintained7 Via InstantMoney * Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
