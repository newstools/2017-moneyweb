JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand rally is probably on its last legs as positive emerging market sentiment fades and contentious issues in local politics come to the fore, a Reuters poll found on Thursday.The start of South Africa&#8217;s credit ratings reviews next month, an African National Congress conference in June and a leadership conference to pick President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s successor in December all have currency strategists on alert.The rand is forecast to weaken 8% to 14.08 per dollar in 12 months, according to a poll of up to 38 strategists taken in the last three days. It currently trades at 13.06 per greenback.Christopher Shiells of Informa Global Markets in London said the rand has remained one of the better emerging market performers in 2017 largely due to the fact that political risks in South Africa have not increased.&#8220;But the rand remains vulnerable to domestic political risks as the year-end ANC conference looms, as well as Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, due to South Africa&#8217;s current account vulnerability,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We see the above factors driving the emerging markets rally running out of steam after the first quarter,&#8221; Shiells added.The rand has leapt more than 5% since the beginning of the year, along with other emerging market currencies as President Donald Trump&#8217;s protectionist rhetoric has increased demand for riskier currencies.Although Trump sounded less combative in tone on his first speech to Congress on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve has set the stage for a possible US interest rate increase later this month after leaving rates unchanged in January.Higher rates in foreign exchange markets tend to attract capital flows, making the rand vulnerable in event of hikes abroad.The repo rate is currently at 7%, a boon for carry trades, a strategy that involves an investor borrowing money at a low interest rate such as Japan&#8217;s in order to invest in an asset with a higher return like South Africa.South Africa&#8217;s benchmark rate is expected to remain unchanged this year. Domestic inflation recently slowed to 6.6% in January and is expected to average 5.8% this year.The majority of strategists polled by Reuters around the globe say there is a downside risk to the dollar if most of Trump&#8217;s planned fiscal stimulus is delayed to next year after he gave few new details on his tax or spending plans.
