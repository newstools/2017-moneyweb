Over the course of 2016, there was a net outflow of R3.25 billion from retail South African general equity funds. That shows that, generally, the appetite for pure equity funds was weak.This is probably not surprising in a year when the FTSE/JSE All Share Index returned just 2.6% including dividends. Much of the local market is also looking very expensive and investors are being told that they shouldn&#8217;t expect high returns from current valuations.What&#8217;s also noteworthy is that an analysis of the outflows indicates that investors pulled a lot of money out of some of the biggest and most established funds in this sector. The table below shows how a number of well known funds saw significant outflows:Net outflows from retail equity funds in 2016FundNet outflowAllan Gray Equity FundR3.84 billionNedgroup Investments Rainmaker FundR1.97 billionCoronation Top 20 FundR1.21 billionFoord Equity FundR1.08 billionInvestec Equity FundR836 millionPrudential Dividend Maximiser FundR652 millionSIM Value FundR374 millionPrudential Equity FundR321 millionNedgroup Investments Value FundR279 millionStanlib SA Equity FundR279 millionCoronation Equity FundR277 millionStanlib Equity FundR218 millionSource: AsisaThese funds are among the 25 that saw the largest net outflows during 2016.The Allan Gray Equity Fund is the largest fund in this category, and so when there are broad outflows it&#8217;s not unusual that it would see the bulk of them. Nevertheless, R3.84 billion is a lot of money. It&#8217;s more than 10% of the fund&#8217;s total assets.It&#8217;s also noteworthy that this was during a year in which the fund outperformed. The Allan Gray Equity Fund returned 9.91%, putting it in the top 15% of equity funds last year.The fund also beat the market the year before, although more marginally, so it&#8217;s difficult to make an argument that investors were moving out for performance-related reasons. This rather appears to be a case of investors and their advisers looking to take some risk off the table and move their money into other asset classes.The story with the Coronation Top 20 fund is, however, slightly different. It too outperformed last year, returning 18.27%. And yet investors withdrew more than 7% of the money in the fund.This however does appear to be a performance-related hangover. The Coronation Top 20 Fund was down 9.84% over 2015 in a market that was up around 5%.The biggest outflows from this fund were in the first two quarters of 2016, which clearly indicates that investors were reacting to these past returns. But once its performance rebounded, it actually received positive net flows in the last quarter of the year.This is a classic example of investors doing exactly the wrong thing selling out when a fund does badly, only to miss the good returns that follow when it recovers, and then reinvesting when the outperformance has already happened.What is interesting, however, is that this behaviour wasn&#8217;t repeated in some of the funds that really outperformed in 2016. The Investec Value Fund shot the lights out last year, growing by 62.37%. And yet investors took R121 million out of the fund over this period.There was also no consistency to these flows. As the table below shows, it had two positive quarters, interspersed with two negative ones:Investec Value Fund net retail flows for 20161st Quarter2nd Quarter3rd Quarter4th Quarter+R9 million-R100 million+R53 million-R82 millionSource: Asisa
