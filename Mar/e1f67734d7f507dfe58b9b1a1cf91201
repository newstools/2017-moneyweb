There is always some debate about the value of unit trust awards. If a fund happens to be at the top of its category over a certain period, does that necessarily mean that its managers have been good, or have they just been lucky at the right time?Any manager worth trusting with your money will acknowledge that luck will always play its part, but the best of them get lucky more often by getting the odds in their favour. That means finding the best opportunities at the lowest risk.This, to some extent, is what Morningstar aims to capture with its annual fund awards. Rather than just recognising the top performers, the company gives awards to those funds that have delivered the best risk-adjusted performance over one, three and five year periods.The methodology Morningstar uses is not made public, but it does say that when measuring risk it penalises downside variation more than upside volatility. This, it believes, identifies the funds that add the most value for investors.At its annual awards presentation in Cape Town on Wednesday evening, the company named the following funds as winners in their respective categories:Best bond fund: Coronation Bond FundRunner-up: Allan Gray Bond Fund Best global equity fund: iShares Core MSCI World USD FundRunner-up: Schroder ISF QEP Global Core Fund Best South African equity fund: Aylett Equity Prescient FundRunner-up: PSG Equity Fund Best cautious allocation fund: Bridge Stable Growth FundRunner-up: SIM Inflation Plus Fund Best moderate allocation fund: Nedgroup Investments Opportunity FundRunner-up: NFB Ci Balanced FoF Best aggressive allocation fund: PSG Balanced FundRunner-up: Allan Gray Balanced Fund Best flexible allocation fund: Centaur BCI Flexible FundRunner-up: Nedgroup Investments Bravata Worldwide Flexible Fund Morningstar only gives a limited number of awards and so does not use the local unit trust categories. It rather uses the categories it employs around the world.This means that in the asset allocation categories, local and global funds compete directly. It is notable, however, that across these categories, the Nedgroup Investments Bravata Worldwide Flexible Fund was the only short-listed portfolio that is not domestic.It is also telling that the winner of the best global fund category is an index tracker. The iShares Core MSCI World USD Fund, which is managed by BlackRock, offers passive exposure to a global index. This demonstrates how difficult it can be for active managers to add value in this space.Morningstar also recognised the asset managers that had shown the best risk-adjusted performance across their fund range. The winners were:Best fund house smaller fund range: Foord Asset ManagementRunners-up: Allan Gray / Truffle Asset Management Best fund house larger fund range: Prudential Investment ManagersRunners-up: Nedgroup Investments / PSG Asset Management
