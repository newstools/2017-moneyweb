The recent initial public offering (IPO) of Snap Inc, the company behind Snapchat, has been a gut wrenching ride for investors looking to get in on opportunities in the rapidly evolving technology sector.Consider this: South African investors, fed-up with the low-growth environment in South Africa and single-digit equity returns are increasingly eyeing offshore markets for their investment capital. Snap comes to market as one of the biggest IPOs in history and on day one it shoots from $17 to $27 Read: Snap tops expectations in pricing of long-awaited IPOAnd then reality sets in that investors are taking a punt on a business which has very little transparency around earnings and the share pulls all the way back to $21.7.Read: Snap tumbles for first time since IPO as analysts say sellIn contrast, South African investors on the JSE have been treated to a string of property investments and Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (Spacs), which bring none of the same energy or opportunities.What many South Africans forget is that from as little as $1 000 (R13 000 at time of writing), they can be investing in some of the most exciting businesses in the world in US dollars and have none of the volatility we saw with Snap.How? The global Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) market is far more advanced than its South African counterpart and there are a variety of ETFs that can give you access to the smartest people and most innovative businesses in the world.Here are just two examples:ARK Industrial Innovation ETFListed in October 2014, this ETF aims to invest in disruptive new technologies including Bitcoin, 3D printing, Big Data and E-Commerce. It s main sectors are healthcare (36%), Information Technology (36%) and Consumer Discretionary (16.7%).According to its last fact sheet, its biggest holdings were Athenahealth, Tesla, Illumina, Stratasys and Amazon. iShares Exponential Technology ETFListed in March 2015, this ETF is slightly newer and aims to invest in global innovation leaders across the world. It s biggest holdings are Indian-based tech groups Wipro and Infosys, followed by Kite Pharma from the US.Both of these ETFs have returned 25% in the last 12 months*, a very solid return for investors.As asset managers, our primary job is to preserve and grow your capital by taking into consideration the risk-return characteristics of potential investment securities.We use ETFs as a strategic tool within client portfolios, such as to gain broad exposure in a certain sector/subsector without having to take the risk of choosing one or two stocks, especially where the portfolio restrictions requires one to do so. From a portfolio perspective, it brings some risk aversion characteristics, coupled with solid return prospects. This is a far more attractive way of investing in high-growth, innovation-focused businesses than trying to find casino-like returns by choosing one share within an industry of stocks.*To be fair, the ARK fund has not be a great performer over the longer term, is relatively expensive relative to other ETFs and doesn t offer a dividend.Steinman de Bruyn, Capilis Asset Managers
