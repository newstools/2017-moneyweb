Markets have started to react negatively to the news that a cabinet reshuffle, involving finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, is finally on the cards.In a statement, the Presidency confirmed that it had instructed minister Gordhan to return to the country from London immediately, where he was attending an investor road show.However, in a Reuters article, the minister said he had not been recalled to South Africa by his President, but &#8220;asked to come back home&#8221; and had been planning to do so anyway.Gordhan, asked by Reuters on the sidelines of investor meetings if he would return said &#8220;yes&#8221;, adding he had not planned to be part of the US leg of the investor roadshow anyway. He declined comment on reasons for his recall and, asked if he expected a cabinet reshuffle, said: &#8220;That&#8217;s the boss&#8217; perogative.&#8221;Nomura strategist Peter Attard-Montalto, says Gordhan is used to playing high-stakes political poker. &#8220;Zuma has laid down a clear red line between him and Gordhan, issuing a direct order for the cancellation of a (what seems to have been relatively last-minute) roadshow to see investors and ratings agencies. Either Gordhan obeys and Zuma is viewed as stronger, or Gordhan disobeys and challenges Zuma. If the roadshow continues then we will know what path is being taken.&#8221; Either way, Montalto believes the risks of Gordhan being fired have clearly risen. But there is still the chance that President Zuma might just want him to be present when he replaces his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, with his favoured pick in the form of Brian Molefe. &#8220; It is also possible that Zuma wants Gordhan there if he reshuffles the deputy only. I have heard no other convincing argument. This is a test of the &#8216;Zuma weak vs Zuma weaker&#8217; split we&#8217;ve had with market opinion and is impossible to call given it ultimately comes down to Zuma&#8217;s risk aversion or not on the issue.&#8221; The timing of the decision is interesting. With just five days to go before the much-publicised extension of the contract to pay social grants by Cash Paymaster Services on April 1, the minister&#8217;s recall could have something to do with this. But, rather menacingly, the recall comes a day after the ANC concluded a meeting with its National Executive Committee (NEC), which took place over the weekend. It also precedes by a couple of days, the High Court hearing into the relief sought by minister Gordhan in the matter over the closure of bank accounts involving the Guptas. So, has Zuma found the support to fire Gordhan?The rand spiked on the news rising from R12.35 to the dollar to R12.45 in a matter of minutes. It is currently trading at R12.58 to the US dollar.
