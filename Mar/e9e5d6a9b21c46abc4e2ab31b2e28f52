Government s direct and indirect stake in Telkom seems to have dropped below 50% for the first time since it warehoused and then sold most of a stake to the Elephant Consortium and Wiphold in a 2005 black economic empowerment transaction. Based on public disclosures by the Public Investment Corporation on its proxy voting record, its shareholding in the telecommunications operator (on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund) dropped to 7.7185% as at the date of Telkom s most recent AGM, August 2016.Previously, it had been above the 10.5% mark for the past decade meaning that, when pooled with government s direct stake, they would account for more than 50% of votes. The 39.76% stake directly held by the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) (and, formerly, the Department of Communications), on behalf of the Government of the Republic of South Africa has not changed materially since Telkom s IPO on the JSE and NYSE in 2003 (it was slightly lower than 39% in 2007, seemingly from a change in the number of shares in issue, but has been above 38% since the IPO in 2003).Holding more than 50% of the votes (on a combined basis) had never been an issue until 2011, when government s golden share (via a Class A shareholding) entitled it to a reservation of certain rights in the control of Telkom . According to the DTPS, this included the rights to appoint [a] specific number of directors and an entitlement to veto certain decisions . This expired upon the eighth anniversary of the group s IPO.Source: Telkom&#8217;s 2016 integrated reportThe PIC s holding, as disclosed by Telkom in its annual reports to the end of March for each year, shows how its interest in the operator has changed over time:These data points (at fixed points in time) ought to be reconciled with the holdings as disclosed in the PIC s published proxy voting record:This means that, if the 7.7185% as disclosed is indeed correct, the PIC s holding dropped below 10.25% (the threshold to ensure 50.01% of votes if pooled with government s stake) between March 31 2016 and August 24 2016 (the date of Telkom s AGM).Telkom s annual (/integrated) report will be published in July and if the PIC s drop below 10% is permanent, this will be disclosed in the shareholding information notes to the annual financial statements. Its AGM is scheduled for August 24 2017.There are more questions than answers about this drop below 50%. Does the PIC see better value elsewhere on the market? Does government think it no longer necessary to control the majority of the voting rights in this state-owned company? Has its holding increased back above the 10.25% level since last year s Telkom AGM?It is worth noting that government (i.e. the DTPS (and formerly DOC) has had a largely hands-off approach since the appointment of and successful turnaround under CEO Sipho Maseko. There has also been a lengthy (and noticeable) period of board stability under chairman Jabu Mabuza since his appointment in 2012.The dividend flow to government via its directly-held stake is important, with the DTPS stating in its 2016 Annual Report that departmental revenue comprises mainly of dividends received from Telkom and Vodacom . Prior to the sale of the Vodacom shares in 2015/16, this dividend flow totaled approximately R1.5 billion R1.6 billion a year.In FY 2016, for example, Telkom s dividend of 270c netted the DTPS R559 million (for its holding of 207 038 058 shares). This (obviously) reduces the pull on the fiscus for funding.The following questions sent to the PIC s Senior Specialist: Investor Relations on February 23 (with a follow-up on February 28) have remained unanswered:A similar set of questions was sent to Telkom s company secretary on March 22.
