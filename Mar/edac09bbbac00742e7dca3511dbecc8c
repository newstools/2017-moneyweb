JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s President Jacob Zuma will not suspend the head of the prosecution service for laying and then withdrawing corruption charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, the presidency said on Friday.&#8220;It is the president&#8217;s well considered view that there is no prima facie evidence pointing to the conduct of three prosecutors, constituting misconduct or lack of fitness,&#8221; the statement said.&nbsp;
