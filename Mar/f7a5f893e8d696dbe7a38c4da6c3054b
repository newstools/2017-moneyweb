PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s current account deficit narrowed as demand for the country&#8217;s commodities rose and inflation slowed, giving policymakers room to leave interest rates unchanged and buoy an ailing economy.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy has stagnated over the past two years as slowdowns in mining and manufacturing and severe drought have strangled growth, stoked inflation and raised the risk of credit downgrades.Data from the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) on Wednesday showed the country&#8217;s current account deficit narrowed more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 to its lowest in nearly six years, helped by a surge in mining exports.The rand rose as much as 0.7% to hit a session high of 12.6000/dollar.In his budget speech in February, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan vowed to narrow both the budget and financial account deficits, in a bid to avoid downgrades to junk status that would push up the country&#8217;s already high borrowing costs.Separately, the statistics agency said consumer inflation slowed to 6.3% year-on-year in February, with food inflation showing a marked decline, after climbing to record highs last year on the back of drought.The central bank, which has cumulatively raised benchmark lending rates by 200 basis points since early 2014 to 7%, aims to keep inflation in the between 3-6% band.In January the bank said it may be near the end of its rate-increase cycle, despite lingering concern over inflation and economic growth. The Sarb&#8217;s monetary policy announces it decision on rates on March 30.The bank forecast the economy would grow 1.1% in 2017.The economy contracted for a second quarter in the final three months of last year and grew by only 0.3% in 2016, well short of the government&#8217;s aim of 5% annual growth.Some analysts believe the Sarb may consider cutting rates.&#8220;All in all, the narrowing of the current account deficit and fall in core inflation reinforce our view that the Reserve Bank will loosen monetary policy this year in order to support the weak economy,&#8221; William Jackson, a London-based analyst at Capital Economics, said in a note.Others said slow economic growth will ultimately see the regulator keep rates at 7%.&#8220;There is good news as well as bad. The test going forward will not be whether South African trade continues to contract. It s whether growth can actually recover strongly,&#8221; said Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa at Standard Charted Bank. ($1 = R12.6500)
