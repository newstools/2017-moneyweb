JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Democratic Alliance, the largest opposition party, said it would ask a court on Friday to block the appointment of new cabinet ministers after President Jacob Zuma roiled markets by sacking Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.&#8220;We will this afternoon file papers in the Western Cape High Court seeking an urgent interdict to halt the swearing in of Jacob Zuma s compromised cabinet members, and the implementation of his reshuffle,&#8221; the Democratic Alliance said in a statement.
