At the Saica/Moneyweb post-budget breakfast on Thursday 23 February, themed Small businesses: Growth drivers of the South African economy, Thoba Grenville-Grey, senior associate: Investment, Awethu Project, shared his thoughts on the speech delivered by finance minister Pravin Gordhan. While the budget touched on the need for skills, government needs to create the space and access for funding, Grenville-Grey says in the interview. &#8220;Other private parties must then come to the table and bring value as well. There needs to be financial and non-financial support.&#8221;The Awethu Project, he says, views its business in two ways; &#8220;we&#8217;re solving for income inequality and for wealth inequality. Income inequality focuses on skills development, and formalising businesses so that they can participate in the economy further.&#8221;Grenville-Grey says the idea of radical economic transformation is somewhat of a misnomer. &#8220;Growth without transformation will entrench inequality and transformation without growth will only facilitate patronage.&#8221;
