Africa&#8217;s biggest mobile phone operator MTN Group swung into a hefty $108 million annual loss on Thursday, its first in two decades, hit by a regulatory fine in Nigeria and unfavourable currency moves.MTN said its headline loss came in at R1.4 billion ($108 million), or 77 cents per share, in the year to end-December compared with headline earnings of R13.6 billion, or 746 cents per share, a year earlier.MTN agreed to pay a fine of 330 billion naira ($1.1 billion), reduced from $5.2 billion, in June last year after a prolonged legal battle to end a dispute in Nigeria over missing a deadline to cut off unregistered SIM cards.The company said the fine wiped R10.5 billion ($768 million) &#8212; 500 cents per share &#8212; from headline earnings, South Africa&#8217;s main measure of profit.Africa&#8217;s most populous nation and biggest economy, Nigeria, is MTN&#8217;s most lucrative but increasingly problematic market.MTN is under investigation by Nigerian lawmakers for allegedly illegally repatriating $14 billion between 2006 and 2016, the second major dispute analysts have said exposes the inherent risk of investing in frontier markets.MTN has denied any wrongdoing.Founded with Pretoria&#8217;s help after the end of white rule in 1994, MTN is seen as one of post-apartheid South Africa&#8217;s biggest commercial successes but clashes with regulators in recent years have exposed governance issues and hobbled growth.
