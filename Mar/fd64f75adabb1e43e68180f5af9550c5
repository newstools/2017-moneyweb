Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Trump moves onPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that will start the process of unwinding a raft of directives to combat climate change. The White House will rescind Obama&#8217;s order to federal agencies to plan for climate change and another to have the military prepare for the national security implications. Investor attention remains on Trump&#8217;s plans to cut taxes, but following the health-care bill misfire, optimism on their effectiveness seems to be waning. Zuma hits randSouth African President Jacob Zuma told leaders of the country&#8217;s Communist Party, and ANC ally, that he plans to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The news comes after the president ordered Gordhan to return home from an investor roadshow yesterday. The rand was trading at 12.962 to the dollar by 5:30am Eastern Time, down more than 4% so far this week. Markets recoverOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7% while Japan&#8217;s Topix index added 1.3% as the dollar regained ground against the yen. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.3% higher by 5:39am with miners leading the gains. US futures point to a gain at the open as the dollar and Treasuries were little changed.Brexit eveTomorrow UK Prime Minster will start the two-year process to negotiate the British exit from the European Union. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the country will have to pay &#8220;nothing like&#8221; the 50 billion-pound ($62 billion) sum floated by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Worries are emerging about the capability of the British civil service to successfully negotiate the exit agreement with head-count there at its lowest level since the 1940s. Coming up&#8230;For Fed-watchers, the big event today is Janet Yellen&#8217;s speech at 12:50pm on workforce development.
