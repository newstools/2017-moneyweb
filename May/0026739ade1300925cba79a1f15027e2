Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday after the release of President Donald Trump&#8217;s budget plan but gains were tempered by declines in consumer discretionary stocks amid weakness in auto-parts companies.While Tuesday&#8217;s economic data was weak, investors were relieved Trump&#8217;s first full budget plan was largely as expected, even if it is not expected to be approved in Congress.&#8220;There were no large surprises. The market is pleased with that,&#8221; said Wade Balliet, Chief Investment Strategist at Bank of the West.Trump&#8217;s budget called for a hike in infrastructure and military spending, along with a raft of politically sensitive cuts, in areas such as healthcare and food assistance programs, with the aim of chopping government spending by $3.6 trillion and balancing the budget over the next decade.The S&amp;P 500 ended below its session high. It topped 2,400 points a few times during the session for the first time since the markets&#8217; plunge last Wednesday on concerns about the future of Trump&#8217;s presidency.While the President is on an overseas trip, stocks were helped by a lack of major news updates related to the government probe on possible ties between his election campaign and Russia.&#8220;With the President being away, with the news cycle slowing a little bit, investors have nibbled their way back in,&#8221; said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.&#8220;This market has had tremendous strength on the idea that the new administration is going to be able to push through a pro-business platform. To the extent it loses political credibility the market has had trouble holding these gains.&#8221;The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.08 points, or 0.21%, to 20,937.91, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.4 points, or 0.18%, to 2,398.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.09 points, or 0.08%, to 6,138.71.In the morning, U.S. economic data showed new single-family home sales in April tumbled from near a nine-and-a-half-year high, while manufacturing activity for May fell to the lowest level since September.Ten of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors ended higher.
