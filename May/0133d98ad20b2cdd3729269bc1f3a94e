JOHANNESBURG &#8211; The influential South African Council of Churches has warned corruption is turning South Africa into a &#8220;mafia state&#8221; under a government that intimidates whistleblowers, local media reported on Friday.In unusually frank comments from the council (SACC), its secretary general Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana was cited as saying President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s government had &#8220;lost the moral radar&#8221;.The criticism puts more pressure on Zuma, who in past weeks has faced calls to resign from within his own ruling African National Congress (ANC) party and the opposition amid a slew of scandals that prompted street protests and credit-rating downgrades.&#8220;We have come to recognise that South Africa may just be a few inches from the throes of a mafia state from which there may be no return, a recipe for a failed state,&#8221; Mpumlwana was quoted as saying.Zuma has consistently denied allegations of corruption levelled against him and his government, and branded protesters calling for his resignation &#8220;racist&#8221;.South Africa is a religious nation and the churches, which played key roles in the struggle against apartheid, have considerable influence.Among the scandals that have rocked Zuma&#8217;s presidency are allegations of influence-peddling by wealthy friends of the president and the misuse of public funds to renovate his private home. A court has also ordered him to give reasons for firing his widely-respected finance minister in April.Releasing the findings of its investigation into graft, the SACC, an inter-denomination grouping that includes the Anglican Church and Dutch Reformed Church, said the ANC had ignored corruption complaints. Whistleblowers were terrified of their own government, it said.Zuma&#8217;s presidency has been beset by allegations of high-level corruption.The nation&#8217;s anti-graft watchdog, in a report released in November, called for a judge to investigate allegations of influence peddling in Zuma&#8217;s government.Zuma and the wealthy Gupta family, which is alleged to wield undue influence over the president, have denied wrongdoing.&#8220;We have come to learn that what appears to be chaos and instability in government may well be a systematic design of the madness that ills our governmental environment &#8211; a chaotic design,&#8221; Mpumlwana added.Even so, Mpumlwana said the SACC would share its findings with the ANC rather than the police or judiciary.
