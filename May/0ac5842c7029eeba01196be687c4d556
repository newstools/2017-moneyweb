On one level, there&#8217;s nothing so surprising about Moody&#8217;s Investors Service&#8217;s decision to downgrade China&#8217;s sovereign debt one notch to A1. Since March last year, when the rating company and its rival S&amp;P Global Ratings cut their outlook on the People&#8217;s Republic&#8217;s credit standing, an eventual demotion has been the most likely outcome.Still, it mustn&#8217;t have been an easy decision, considering the tongue-lashing they got from the Chinese finance minister at last year&#8217;s Group of 20 meeting over the &#8220;bias&#8221; in their assessment.&nbsp;The timing is also puzzling because it&#8217;s embarrassingly close to last month&#8217;s all-important gathering of China&#8217;s top politicians on &#8220;safeguarding national financial-market security&#8221;. The $450 billion that disappeared in a matter of days from Chinese stock and bond markets &#8212; plus the roughly $50 billion of liquidity injected by the central bank into a nervous money market &#8212; show that investors take President Xi Jinping&#8217;s resolve to wring the economy of excessive leverage seriously. Moody&#8217;s is thus sticking its neck out a little when it says the planned reform program will probably slow, but not prevent, the rise in debt levels.Bravery aside, is Moody&#8217;s being too pessimistic?The government&#8217;s indebtedness is only a problem in China because the corporate sector is overextended. A year ago, a majority of the bonds that were rated AAA by the more effervescent local Chinese rating companies were actually junk on a Bloomberg credit-scoring metric. But today, only 14 out of 127 such bonds &#8212; or 11 percent &#8212; are in that risky category. Things are looking better for corporate debt in China, not worse.Besides, if rating changes on Japan&#8217;s sovereign debt are any guide, investors have every reason to shrug off Wednesday&#8217;s news.After all, it costs about $25,000 nowadays to insure $10 million of Japanese five-year debt against default, or about half what investors had to pay when Moody&#8217;s cut Japan by one notch to A1 in December 2014.In China&#8217;s case, it appears that both Moody&#8217;s and S&amp;P were wrong to have rewarded Beijing&#8217;s IOUs with an upgrade to double AA territory in the final two months of 2010.That was a year and half after Fitch Ratings prophetically warned of the banking industry&#8217;s &#8220;steep rise in corporate exposure&#8221; that would over time &#8220;take its toll on corporate borrowers&#8217; ability to repay.&#8221; (Incidentally, Fitch hasn&#8217;t fiddled with its China sovereign rating in almost a decade; so it&#8217;s spared the embarrassment of any dialing-down now.)The other two have no choice. Staying pat, and hoping that reality will eventually catch up with expectations, doesn&#8217;t always work. S&amp;P saw that this week when it had to upgrade Indonesia to investment grade &#8212; five years after its rivals.But any feeling of relief would have been short-lived. Now that Moody&#8217;s has moved first with China, the ball is once again in S&amp;P&#8217;s court. That begs the question: How much of this sovereign-rating guff is really about countries&#8217; creditworthiness versus pure inter-company rivalry?This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. 2017 Bloomberg L.P
