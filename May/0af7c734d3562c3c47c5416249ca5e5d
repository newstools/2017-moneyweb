British police said 22 people including some children were killed in a suicide attack carried out by one man after a Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on Monday.&#8220;We believe, at this stage, the attack last night was conducted by one man,&#8221; Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said.&#8220;The priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.&#8220;The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena. We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device which he detonated causing this atrocity.&#8221;British police said the incident, in which at least 50 people were injured, was being treated as a terrorist incident. Police carried out a controlled explosion on a suspect device several hours after the blast.Police said they responded to reports of an explosion shortly after 10:35 pm (2135 GMT) at the arena, which has a capacity for 21,000 people, and where the U.S. singer had been performing to an audience that included many children.If confirmed as a terrorism incident, it would be the deadliest attack in Britain by militants since four British Muslims killed 52 people in suicide bombings on London&#8217;s transport system in July 2005.The blast also came two and half weeks ahead of an election in which Prime Minister Theresa May is predicted by opinion polls to win a large majority.A witness who attended the concert said she felt a huge blast as she was leaving the arena, followed by screaming and a rush by thousands of people trying to escape the building. A video posted on Twitter showed fans, many of them young, running from the venue.&#8220;We were making our way out and when we were right by the door there was a massive explosion and everybody was screaming,&#8221; concert-goer Catherine Macfarlane told Reuters.&#8220;It was a huge explosion &#8211; you could feel it in your chest. It was chaotic. Everybody was running and screaming and just trying to get out.&#8221;A spokesman for Ariana Grande, 23, said the singer was &#8220;okay&#8221;.Manchester Arena, the largest indoor arena in Europe, opened in 1995 and is a popular concert and sporting venue.Britain is on its second-highest alert level of &#8220;severe&#8221; meaning an attack by militants is considered highly likely.British counter-terrorism police have said they are making on average an arrest every day in connection with suspected terrorism.In March, a British-born convert to Islam ploughed a car into pedestrians on London&#8217;s Westminster Bridge, killing four people, before stabbing to death a police officer who was on the grounds of parliament. He was shot dead at the scene.
