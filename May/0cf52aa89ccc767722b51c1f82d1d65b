Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Metals fallIron ore futures plunged in China, ending the session limit-down, as investor concern over both Chinese demand and Australian supply weighed on prices. Base metals were falling across the board, with copper extending yesterday&#8217;s 3.5% drop, and nickel dropping 2%. The Bloomberg World Mining Index of shares fell for the fourth day.Healthcare bill House Republicans plan to vote today on measure to repeal Obamacare, with a number of GOP moderates remaining opposed to or undecided about the plan. The success or failure of the vote is seen as a significant test for both President Donald Trump and Congressional leaders who have very little to show by way of legislative accomplishments so far this year. French debateA snap survey of likely voters showed that 63% thought independent Emmanuel Macron prevailed in last night&#8217;s head-to-head debate with Marine Le Pen. With polls ahead of Sunday&#8217;s vote showing Macron maintaining his 20-point lead, markets are unlikely to budge much if he is victorious, but there still could be some winners. If Le Pen surprises on Sunday, the moves would be far greater. Markets riseOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index fell 0.3%. Japanese markets remain closed until Monday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.4% higher at 5:52am Eastern Time as positive earnings from Royal Dutch Shell and HSBC Holdings outweighed the slide in miners. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.3%. Coming up&#8230;After yesterday&#8217;s Federal Reserve statement confirming the bank&#8217;s gradual tightening stance, investors must go back to the data to see if the US economy&#8217;s soft first quarter was a blip. At 8:30am Eastern Time, initial jobless claims data are released, with expectations for a drop to 248 000. At 10:00am factory orders and durable good orders for March are released. 2017 Bloomberg
