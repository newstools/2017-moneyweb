CAPE TOWN &#8211; Six South African telecoms companies, including MTN Group and Vodacom, can keep their broadband radio spectrum licences until they expire in 2028 after agreeing to buy at least 30% of the government&#8217;s new Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN), the communications minister said on Wednesday.Minister Siyabonga Cwele told reporters an agreement was reached with operators on May 19, after they initially opposed a government plan forcing them to give up their broadband spectrum and share a national network instead.The agreement ends the uncertainty over a policy which has been criticised by industry and seen to be holding back WOAN&#8217;s implementation after the government suggested that mobile operators would not get any new frequencies and needed to hand back what they had.&#8220;The key, important thing is the return of spectrum,&#8221; said Cwele ahead of his ministry&#8217; budget vote speech in parliament.&#8220;For you to lay down your network on the basis you have spectrum, and then if your spectrum is removed, it may affect your continuing investment and cause uncertainty,&#8221; he said. ahead of his ministry&#8217;s budget vote speech in parliament.Creating a single open-access network lies at the heart of a government goal to roll out mobile broadband access in Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy, where the state wants to drive down high data prices hampering business development.Alongside MTN and Vodacom, the other licensees are state-owned Telkom, MultiSource Telecom, Cell C and Liquid Telecom.
