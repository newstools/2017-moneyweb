JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Pioneer Food Group expects a stronger profit in the second half of its financial year on lower maize prices after reporting a 47% drop in earnings in the half year to March on Monday.Pioneer&#8217;s headline earnings per share fell to 253.4 cents for the six months to March 31 from 479.3 cents a year ago as higher maize prices following a severe drought raised costs for its essential foods and grocery divisions.Pioneer said in a statement lower maize input costs from June, lower beverage input costs and increased raisin supply would buoy its second-half performance.&#8220;The first half impact, which was severe, cannot be recovered in the second half. We do expect however an improvement versus the prior year in the second half in groceries and our food essentials business,&#8221; chief executive Phil Roux said in a results presentation.&#8220;The drought of 2016 led to a local shortage of maize and consequently higher raw material prices,&#8221; acting chief financial officer Cas Lamprecht said.
