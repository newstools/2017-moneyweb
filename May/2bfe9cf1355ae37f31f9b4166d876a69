Insurers are turning to social media to assess the validity of large claims, sometimes even catching out consumers and rejecting claims based on contradictory information. The trend emerged in 2016, when social media appeared to be useful in assessing motor insurance, particularly when consumers presented incorrect information about the regular driver of a vehicle in order to pay lower premiums. Our office sees far too many claims being submitted where, for example, parents have represented that they will be the regular driver of a vehicle when in fact the vehicle was purchased by them for use by their child, says Deanne Wood, Ombudsman for Short-Term Insurance (OSTI). Paying the lower premium is all well and good until a loss is suffered. Simple desk-top investigations using Facebook or other social media searches can all too easily reveal misrepresentations made by consumers who forget to cover their tracks when making misrepresentations to their insurance companies.

Any information posted on publicly accessible social media accounts is fair game and some insurers even ask to speak with a claimant s friends or family if they re tagged in posts that may be of interest, said the insurance professional. In presenting the OSTI s annual report, Woods said motor insurance disputes make up the majority of claims submitted to her office. Some 49% or 4 991 of the 14 916 complaints lodged with the OSTI in 2016 related to motor insurance, of which 4 207 were closed and 1 314 were resolved.

But closed 8 613 complaints or 1 313 fewer cases than the prior year due to operational changes and a new focus on quality outcomes. It recovered R99.1 million in favour of the insured and maintained a constant overturn rate, where decisions are made with some benefit to the insured, of 27%.Source: OSTI, 2017Among the large insurers, 368 545 complaints were received by Santam, of which 617 were also registered with the OSTI and 146 were resolved in favour of the client. Hollard received 363 898 complaints, with 695 being referred to the OSTI and 202 being resolved with some benefit for the client. OUTsurance registered 279 437 complaints, with 404 lodged with the OSTI and only 47% resolved in favour of the client. No other registered insurer received in excess of 200 000 claims.
