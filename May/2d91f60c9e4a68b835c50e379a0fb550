Russian State-owned nuclear company Rosatom has affirmed its long-term commitment to South Africa and the broader continent, in the wake of the decision by the Western Cape High Court last week to set aside the procurement process pursued by Eskom.Read: Court declares nuclear plan with Russia unlawfulRosatom says the decision has no direct relation or bearing on the company s presence in the country, nor on any future involvement in a nuclear procurement process the country may pursue. The determination refers to the internal ratification procedures of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa for three government-to-government agreements signed in 2014 with Russia, South Korea and the US. This determination does not directly affect the scope of these agreements, which is the cooperation with the Republic of South Africa in terms of nuclear power development for peaceful purposes, said Rosatom in a release distributed on Wednesday.The bottom line is that the company is not going anywhere and, should the Department of Energy begin anew, the company will engage in the process. The company will also continue to sustain its collaboration agreements it has signed with universities such as the North-West and will continue to fund bursaries for students of nuclear energy on the continent.
