Advocate Deon Irish SC on Tuesday told the High Court in Pretoria there is no reason known to man or beast why essential services cannot be isolated from municipal electricity grids and supplied directly by Eskom.Acting for Mediclinic Brits, Irish said his client had nothing to do with the dispute between Eskom and the local Madibeng municipality about Madibeng s failure to pay its Eskom bills, but the risk to Mediclinic s patients if Eskom disconnects the whole of Madibeng including the hospital, outweighs the importance of Eskom s debt collection.Mediclinic s application is being heard together with several others, all aimed at having Eskom s decisions to disconnect electricity supply to the Madibeng and Lekwa municipalities reviewed and set aside. Madibeng is based in Brits in the North West and Lekwa in Standerton in Mpumalanga.Apart from Mediclinic, the applicants include tyre manufacturer Bridgestone and six other large users who together represent 60% of Madibeng s electricity revenue. In court papers they state that 2 400 jobs could be at stake if their electricity supply is interrupted.In February Eskom agreed to refrain from cutting the supply until the review applications have been finalised.Poultry producer Astral Foods and animal food producers Meadow Feeds then reached an agreement with Eskom and Lekwa with regard to the disconnection of electricity supply to Lekwa, as did Standerton Oil Mills and its holding company Cofco SA.It was agreed that the companies would make their monthly electricity payments into the trust account of Lekwa s attorney who would pay it over to Eskom without any deduction. The companies will continue to do so until the review application has been finalised.On Tuesday Irish said if Eskom wanted to disconnect Madibeng, it first had to make provision for continued supply to Mediclinic s hospital. He argued that electricity supply to essential services like the hospital should be excluded from the disconnection.He denied being alarmist as Eskom alleges, saying the things Mediclinic fears might happen if the electricity supply is disconnected might not realise, but who takes that risk? Eskom s suggestion that Mediclinic should rely on generators is not realistic, Irish said. The hospital s two generators are designed as back-up, not to run the hospital on as primary supply option for the five hours per day Eskom would disconnect Madibeng.He said while Eskom is not responsible for the provision of water, electricity is a prerequisite for the provision of water in urban areas as it powers the relevant pumps. Mediclinic uses 4 000 liters per hour and has a tank with a capacity of 17 000 liters. If the electricity supply is disconnected for five hours per day, the tanks never fill up completely and the levels will drop gradually. Water supply is crucial for hygiene, infection control and food production in the hospital, he said.Eskom cannot embark on an action of cutting electricity supply if it cannot guarantee that Mediclinic and its patients constitutional right to water won t be infringed, he said.He said if Eskom s distribution license in Madibeng restricts it from providing electricity supply directly to Mediclinic and other essential services, the license could be amended. He pointed out that Eskom supplies about 400 000 other small and large businesses directly even though such businesses are also within the boundaries of municipalities that distribute electricity.Irish further pointed out that Eskom s agreement with the Brits Transitional Council, which is the legal predecessor of Madibeng, provides that Madibeng should provide the infrastructure for Eskom to supply the municipality and other Eskom clients with electricity. He said the agreement could be extended to the provision of the necessary infrastructure to isolate essential services like the hospital from the rest of the municipal grid, in order to spare such services if Madibeng is disconnected.The hearing will continue on Wednesday.
