DURBAN &#8211; Zimbabwe&#8217;s 93-year-old president, Robert Mugabe, sat slumped in his chair, wringing his hands, as he told a panel discussion on Thursday in a low murmur that his country was not a &#8220;fragile state&#8221;.Mugabe&#8217;s government is struggling with a debt crisis, a fall in foreign exchange inflows, and acute shortages of cash that have forced banks to limit withdrawals, as well as growing resistance to his three-decade rule.But he told a panel discussion on &#8220;fragile countries&#8221; at the World Economic Forum for Africa in the South African city of Durban that Zimbabwe&#8217;s economy was on the mend. &#8220;Zimbabwe is not a fragile state, it is one of the most highly developed countries, second after South Africa,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You cannot even talk about us as a &#8216;fragile state&#8217; from an economic point of view.&#8221;Watch eNCA&#8217;s video of Robert Mugabe at he World Economic Forum for Africa below:&nbsp;Critics have accused Mugabe of wrecking one of Africa&#8217;s most promising economies and causing unemployment of currently around 80% through policies such as violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms and money printing.He and his party say the economy has been undermined by Western powers.&#8220;This year we will have a bumper harvest.
