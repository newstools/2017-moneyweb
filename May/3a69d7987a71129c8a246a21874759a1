Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Fed decisionAt 2:00pm Eastern Time the Federal Reserve will announce its latest monetary policy decision, with none of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg expecting any change in rates. With market-implied probabilities showing just over a 50% chance of two rate hikes by the end of the year, the statement will be scrutinised for further signalling of an increase next month. The bank&#8217;s plans for reducing the size of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet are also likely to be a central topic of discussion. There is no press conference following today&#8217;s decision.Trump&#8217;s good callThe White House described a phone conversation between President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, in which they agreed to step up cooperation on Syria, as &#8220;very good.&#8221; The Kremlin said in a statement following the call that the leaders had agreed to a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of July&#8217;s G-20 summit in Germany. The president&#8217;s other communications yesterday proved more controversial, however, after he tweeted that a &#8220;shutdown&#8221; in September would fix the logjam in Congress. Oil recoversA barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was trading at $48.15 by 5:38am, staging a recovery from yesterday&#8217;s drop to a six-week low. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries deepened production cuts in April with output falling by 40 000 barrels a day from a month earlier. Non-Opec producer Russia will back an extension of the production cut deal that ends in June, according to a government official with knowledge of the matter.Markets slipOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index fell 0.2%. Markets in Japan and Hong Kong were closed due to a holiday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.2% lower at 5:48am with miners leading the losses. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.2% as investors awaited the Fed decision. Brexit talksIn Brussels this morning, European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier revealed his vision for how talks on the UK&#8217;s exit would progress. In Britain, Brexit Secretary David Davis flatly rejected a report in the Financial Times suggesting the bill for exiting the union could be as high as 75 billion euros ($82 billion), saying the UK would walk away from a deal with the bloc if provoked. The pound was trading at $1.2910 at 5:55am as the fractious atmosphere surrounding the negotiations shows little sign of improving. 2017 Bloomberg
