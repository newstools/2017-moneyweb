JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s state-owned power utility Eskom said on Wednesday it had brought Unit 2 of its Koeberg nuclear plant back into operation, about a month after a controlled shutdown for routine maintenance and refuelling. Koeberg, the sole nuclear power plant in South Africa, has two units and provides 1 800 megawatts of power to the national grid.
