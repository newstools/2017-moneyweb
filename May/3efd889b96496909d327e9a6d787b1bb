JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed on Thursday, continuing to benefit from the dollar&#8217;s recent weakness and growing appetite globally for emerging market currencies.At 0645 GMT the rand was 0.3% firmer at 13.4500 per dollar compared to a close of 13.4900 overnight in New York, bringing the week&#8217;s gains close to 2%.The unit started the week off on the backfoot after the victory of a centre-left candidate in the French presidential election and increased signs of an interest rate hike in the United States but has steadily ground as risk currencies and commodities returned to favour.The rand briefly breached short-term resistance around the 13.45 mark but failed to consolidate the position.South Africa&#8217;s statistics agency publishes mining production and manufacturing data in the session, with the latter figures expected to show secondary sector activity remains subdued.Stocks were set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index up 0.2%.The yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 inched up 0.5 basis points to 8.75%.
