Protests in South Africa over a lack of access to housing, water and electricity that erupted in Johannesburg at the start of the week spread to parts of the capital, Pretoria, with police firing rubber bullets at a group who looted shops, barricaded roads and set tires and trash bins alight.Several people who joined the demonstrations in the Laudium township, southwest of Pretoria, were arrested and will face charges of public violence, Isaac Mahamba, a senior superintendent for the metropolitan police force, said on Wednesday by phone. While the crowds dispersed after being addressed by city officials, the police remain on high alert, he said.Violent public protests have become commonplace among residents of poor South African communities who still lack basic services 23 years after the end of white-minority rule and see few other options to draw attention to their plight. Criminals often take advantage of the disorder to loot shops and steal, according to the police and government. The latest demonstrations began in the southern Johannesburg suburb of Eldorado Park on May 8 and spread to the Ennerdale, Klipspruit and Orange Farm townships. A total of 62 people have been arrested in those areas and will face public violence charges, Eyewitness News reported, citing police.Another protest took place late Tuesday in Thohoyandou in the northern province of Limpopo where a group of more than 700 set a police station and two government vehicles alight, Johannesburg-based broadcast eNCA reported, citing police spokesman Motlafela Mojapelo. 2017 Bloomberg
