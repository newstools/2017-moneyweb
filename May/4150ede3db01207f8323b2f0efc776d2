JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand firmed on Monday along with other emerging currencies as the dollar took a hit from geopolitical fears following North Korea&#8217;s missile test and by a batch of weak data.At 0645 GMT the rand was 0.73% firmer at 13.2700 per dollar, extending last week&#8217;s gains to a new two-week high, having closed at 13.3675 on Friday in New York.The greenback was pinned back after North Korea said it had successfully tested a new mid-to-long range missile able to carry a large-scale nuclear warhead.The news triggered an uptick in demand for emerging currencies and safe-haven securities like gold and other metals.The rand was also propelled by weaker-than-anticipated US inflation and retails sales data deep into Friday&#8217;s local trade session, with demand for the unit spilling over into Monday trade.The next technical resistance milestone is around 13.2500, although traders expect political headlines to limit gains, this after state power utility Eskom reinstated Brian Molefe as chief executive five months after he was implicated in a corruption report. He has denied any wrongdoing.Volatility levels suggest continued gains, with one-month implied volatility on the currency at the lowest since March.Stocks are set to go marginally higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index up 0.24%.Bonds also firmed, with the yield for the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 4 basis points to 8.665%.
