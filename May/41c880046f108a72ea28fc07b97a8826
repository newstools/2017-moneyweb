There is no clear winner among the country s five retail banks when it comes to transformation when measured on the employment equity score. In aggregate terms, Capitec Bank leads the way with nearly nine black employees out of every ten. In its annual report, the bank says its approach to employment equity integrates with its strategy for staffing of branches, which is aligned to the local demographic of each branch by employing people from the surrounding area, ensuring [a] cultural fit with the client . Unsurprisingly, Capitec also has the youngest workforce among the five, with 71% of its staff under the age of 31 (and 88% under 36).Barclays Africa Group lags on this aggregate measure of employment equity, with only 69% of its South African workforce black as at December 31, 2016. FirstRand, Nedbank Group and Standard Bank Group are at 76%, 78% and 79%, respectively.Number of permanent employees in South AfricaBlack employees as % of overall permanent workforceFirstRand37 92076%Standard Bank Group35 76579%Barclays Africa Group30 73969%Nedbank Group28 18578%Capitec Bank12 98489% Source: Moneyweb analysis of bank annual/transformation reports, submissions to ParliamentIt is important to note that this overall measure does not carry any score in the BEE sector code. But, without a representative overall employee base, it will be near impossible to meet management targets, which do matter.% top management black% senior management black% middle management black% junior management blackBarclays Africa Group26%40%55%75%Capitec Bank17%11%34%79%FirstRand34%*35%59%81%Nedbank Group54%38%60%88%Standard Bank Group22%41%68%87%Targets (Current FS sector code)40%60%75%80%Targets (Draft FS sector code)60%60%75%88%* As presented to Parliament. If just Stratco was used, as is the case in other banks, this would drop to 22%.Source: Moneyweb analysis of bank annual/transformation reports, submissions to ParliamentOn the current scorecard, three of the five banks meet the target when it comes to junior management. In submissions to Parliament s hearings on transformation in the sector, most banks seemed to indicate that progress had been sufficient in both junior and middle management ranks. Barclays Africa chief executive Maria Ramos made the point that there is steady progress being made in all tiers of management but more needs to be done . The bank says 88% of new hires are black, and 83% of new promotions are too.Source: Barclays Africa GroupIn FirstRand s submission, chief executive Johan Burger cited good progress in junior and middle management . Standard Bank s presentation also only identified senior and top management as an issue. It says black staff comprise 50% of the promotions into senior and executive management and 90% of those into junior and middle management.Source: Standard Bank GroupHowever, when looking at the middle management score, no bank is anywhere near the current (and likely future) sector target of 75%. Only Standard Bank, at 68%, has a realistic chance of reaching this in the near term.In senior management, the picture deteriorates further with four of the five banks hovering around the 40% mark. This clustering points to a structural/supply problem in the sector, and with good and decent progress in the junior and middle management ranks, respectively, this situation will resolve itself automatically in time.When it comes to top management, however, only Nedbank can be commended. It has managed to substantially transform its exco. With 54% of the 13-person executive leadership team being black, it currently exceeds the target of 40% and has a realistic chance to meet the new target of 60% in the draft sector code. In FirstRand s submission, Burger pointed out that top management progress has been slower than hoped and more work needs to be done .ExcoBlack maleBlack femaleWhite maleWhite femaleBarclays Africa Group2262Capitec Bank20100FirstRand*2070Nedbank Group5251Standard Bank Group2363*StratcoSource: Moneyweb analysis of bank annual/transformation reports, submissions to ParliamentNedbank is the obvious outlier on this measure. The other banks are all at around the 25% mark, with FirstRand at either 22% if the strict definition of Stratco (its exco) was used, or 34% as per its submission to Parliament.In FirstRand s submission, Burger pointed out that supply has been one of the constraints when it comes to progress in top management.Using the supply of Chartered Accountants as a proxy, FirstRand pointed out that only 26% of the CA base in the country was black. This is a substantial improvement on the 7% in 2002, but was still far off being representative. What is surprising is that Capitec is in (the distant) last place on every measure but one, and on that score (junior management) it is in second-last place. The bank does not provide any detail on how it&#8217;s addressing this issue in its annual report, and is among the three banks who do not produce a specific transformation/B-BBEE report annually (only Nedbank Group and Barclays Africa Group do, while Standard Bank Group and FirstRand s operating units (including FNB) publish broader Reports to Society ).One area where Capitec ought to be commended is the fact that it has two development seats on its executive committee that rotate annually. These provide senior employees with the opportunity to gain experience at an executive level . The bank says the development members for 2018 are Jerome Passmore (head of its project office) and Dumisani Ncukana (operations manager at head office).Employment equity, however, is but one score when measuring against the sector s BEE scorecard. Currently, it accounts for 15 of the available 100 points, and three of the seven bonus points). Management control counts for eight points out of 100, and one bonus point. In the draft amended financial sector code, published for public comment a year ago, the measurement shifts from employment equity to management control only.The draft amended code states the following targets when it comes to management control (which accounts for 20 of the 112 points for banks):Management control scorecard20 pointsBoard participation5 pointsOther executive management3 points (of which 1 relates to the above target)Senior management4 points (of which 2 relate to the above target)Middle management4 points (of which 2 relate to the above target)Junior management3 points (of which 1 relates to the above target) * Hilton Tarrant works at immedia.
