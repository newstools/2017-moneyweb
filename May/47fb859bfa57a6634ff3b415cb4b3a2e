Net1 UEPS Technologies Inc. said it s agreed to pay its founder and chief executive officer an $8 million severance payment and an about 14% premium on his shares after he agreed to step down amid a storm of controversy over a contract it holds in South Africa to distribute billions of dollars of welfare payments to 17 million people.Serge Belamant will also be paid $50,000 a month to consult for the company after his early retirement, the company said in a disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Net1 agreed to buy back over 1 million shares he owns at $10.80 a share. It agreed to allow the accelerated vesting of 200,000 shares and the repurchase of more than 252,000 in-the-money stock options at $10.80 a share minus the applicable excercise price per option.The stock closed 1% lower at R124.39.Net1 won a contract in 2012 to distribute welfare in South Africa. Two years later, the country s Constitutional Court ruled the contract invalid and instructed the South African Social Security Agency to find a new provider. When it failed to do so by March this year, the court allowed the contract to be extended until 2018 under stringent conditions.Net1 has been accused by human-rights organizations of selling goods and services to South Africa s poorest and least-educated ranging from loans to mobile-phone airtime without explaining the terms and costs adequately and by improperly using information gleaned from its grant distribution activity. It has denied the allegations. 2017 Bloomberg
