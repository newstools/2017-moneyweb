With decades of successful local and international business leadership under his belt, Bonang Mohale likes to use the following metaphor when discussing what he believes to be one of the most important aspects of creating a corporate culture: &#8230; a farmer does not spend 80% of his or her time, massaging the individual seeds &#8211; but they do spend 80% of their time preparing the soil, the environment. In other words Mohale believes that, if the desired fruit of that business environment is remarkable results, the only way to cultivate the environment is to fully empower each and every person working in the business &#8211; giving them the right (and reward) to be a meaningful contributor. But how, exactly, does one pull off such an ambitious idea? In this 3 30 Quick Insight, extracted from a full length interview, Mohale shares his own approach.View the full length interview here.In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people.
