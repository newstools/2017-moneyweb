South Africa is in talks with China&#8217;s Sinopec about its takeover of Chevron Corp&#8217;s Cape Town refinery as it wants to ensure its production capacity is retained and enhanced, Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel said on Thursday.Sinopec will pay almost $1 billion for a 75 percent stake in Chevron Corp&#8217;s South African assets and its subsidiary in Botswana to secure its first major refinery in Africa, the companies announced in March.&#8220;A key concern that government will raise in every major transaction like this is how to retain and expand our industrial capability and includes in this case, refinery capability,&#8221; Patel told reporters before his budget vote speech in parliament.Patel&#8217;s ministry oversees competition authorities in Africa&#8217;s most industrialised country.South Africa has a history of taking its time over approving takeovers, partly because competition authorities have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs in addition to an antitrust mandate to maintain competition.In 2011, the regulator told U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores not to cut jobs for two years following its acquisition of South African retailer Massmart, delaying implementation of the $2.4 billion deal by at least two months.Last year, Anheuser-Busch InBev said it would invest 1 billion rand ($77.3 million) to support small South African farmers as part of concessions agreed with the government to secure regulatory approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of SABMiller.Patel did not go into details of the Sinopec discussions, saying the deal with Chevron would still need to go for formal regulatory scrutiny.
