South Africa&#8217;s Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Monday the treasury would use its R500 billion ($40 billion) annual procurement budget to transform the economy and give more support to black-owned businesses.&#8220;The strategic use of state procurement is an important lever to grow black business,&#8221; Gigaba told a business dinner in Johannesburg. &#8220;The state getting value for money is important but this aim should be considered in conjunction with our economic history.&#8221;Gigaba, appointed after President Jacob Zuma sacked his predecessor, has backed Zuma&#8217;s aim of redistributing wealth to poor blacks but said this would not involve a shift away from the fiscal consolidation outlined in recent budgets.
