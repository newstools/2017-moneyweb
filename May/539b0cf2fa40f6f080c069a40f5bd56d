How do you get ordinary people in your organisation, to produce extraordinary outcomes? According to Bonang Francis Mohale, Shell South Africa s Vice President Upstream &amp; Chairman Downstream, that is the key to creating movement and influencing people. It s exactly what is required to be a leader of real consequence.In this full length, face-to-face interview, Mohale &#8211; who is also the deputy chairman of Business Leadership SA &#8211; takes the viewer from his days as an ordinary township kid, to gaining entrance to an all-white Medical School in the days of apartheid, and his subsequent meteoric rise in both the local and international corporate world.Along the way he shares the valuable human and corporate lessons learnt; his single-minded goal in all of his business endeavours for 100% international competitiveness, and a seemingly indomitable belief that he s had since childhood: I can do anything I want to. In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people. The interview draws on the person s life, failures and the lessons they have learnt on their journey to the successful leadership positions they hold today.Other business leaders share their stories here.
