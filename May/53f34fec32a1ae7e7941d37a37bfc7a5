JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa is set to avoid slipping into a technical recession this year following surprise improvements in mining and manufacturing output, although the economy remains under pressure due to recent credit downgrades to junk.The economy contracted 0.3% in the final quarter of 2016 and a second consecutive contraction would have pushed the economy into recession for the first time since the global finiancial crisis of 2009.Mining output beat expectations of a 4.3% increase, with demand from China and higher commodity prices globally propelling the sector&#8217;s output to a two-year high.While growth in manufacturing was modest, at 0.3% year-on-year in March, after shrinking by 3.7% in February, it was comfortably wide of market expectations of a 2% contraction.&#8220;The improved mining, growth in agriculture and the improved vehicle sales should keep first quarter GDP growth in positive territory,&#8221; senior economist at Nedbank Nicky Weimar said.Treasury has said it expects the economy to expand by 1.3% this year. On Tuesday the International Monetary Fund said it saw South Africa&#8217;s growth at 0.8% in 2017.The decision in April by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch to downgrade South Africa to subinvestment after President Jacob Zuma removed Pravin Gordhan as finance minister had increased the risk of recession.The rand plunged about 12% in the wake of the cabinet changes, prompting the central bank to put off possible interest rate cuts due to a weaker currency stoking inflation. The downgrade has also limited already dire levels of investment.But the steep jump in mining output in March, by 15.5% according to Statistics South Africa data on Thursday, combined with a surprise rebound in manufacturing could see growth remain in the black, economists said.&#8220;That will be a sizeable contribution to quarter one growth especially if we expect the agricultural sector to start to contribute positively,&#8221; said Elize Kruger of NKC African Economics, who forecasts first quarter growth at 1%.Nedbank&#8217;s Weimar said the the downgrades to junk were the big negative.
