JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s manufacturing output grew by 0.3% year-on-year in March, beating market expectations of a contraction, having shrunk by a revised 3.7% in February, Statistics South Africa said on Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing volumes would contract by 2% year-on-year in March.However, factory production contracted on a month-on-month basis, shrinking 0.6%, and was down 0.9% in the three months to March compared with the previous three months.According to Nedbank, the sector is still expected to fare moderately better in 2017, with output rising off last year s low base as global growth accelerates moderately and international commodity prices continue to drift higher.Most statistics suggest that the economy probably managed modest growth of around 1% in the first quarter. At same time, inflation has eased to just over 6% in March, while inflation outlook has also improved slightly since the last MPC meeting. Food inflation has moderated significantly, the rate of recovery in global oil prices has slowed and the rand has been remarkably resilient despite the escalation in political turmoil since late March and the resultant rating downgrades to junk status by two major rating agencies, Nedbank says.However, the bank believes that MPC will probably remain cautious. There are still considerable downside risks for the rand, given the unsettled domestic political environment and the relatively high risk of further sovereign risk rating downgrades.Nedbank expects that the MPC will probably opt to leave interest rates unchanged and may even hike if the rand comes under renewed pressure.
