JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African retailer Edcon has chosen former Massmart boss Grant Pattison to take over as chief executive next year, the company said on Thursday.Edcon, bought out by Bain Capital in a highly leveraged deal a decade ago, has struggled as growth in South Africa has floundered, forcing it into a debt-for-equity swap last year.Chief executive Bernie Brookes, who oversaw the debt-for-equity swap, will extend his two-year contract, which would have expired in September, to January 2018, the company said in a statement.Pattison, chief executive of Massmart from 2007-2014, will be appointed chief operating officer and chief executive designate on June 5. He will take over as chief executive at the end of January, Edcon said.The retailer, in a separate statement, reported a sales decrease of 6.7% to R25.3 billion ($1.96 billion) for the financial year to end-March.
