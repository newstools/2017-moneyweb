The report commissioned by Eskom to evaluate the contracts relating to four mines supplying its power stations reveals how eager and sloppy the state-utility was in awarding the ten-year contract to the Brakfontein mine to supply the Majuba power station.PWC was appointed to conduct a review of the coal quality management of certain coal suppliers and Eskom&#8217;s contracted laboratories following allegations discussed in a &#8220;clarification meeting&#8221; held in September 2015.It was Tegeta Exploration and Resources&#8217;s (owned by the Guptas and President Zuma s son) first engagement with Eskom, and judging by the evaluation made by PWC, it was riddled with conflict of interest and hastiness from the beginning.Eskom s Procurement and Supply Management Procedures expressly forbid contracts to be awarded without a formal tender process, according to the PWC report which states: &#8220;Sole adjudication are no longer permitted, at any level of delegation. Yet the firm expressly found that the procurement of coal supply from Tegeta was secured by means of an unsolicited offer, and was thus received outside a competitive tender/enquiry process. The report found:PWC summarised the dealings as such: &#8220;The contract was signed on March 10, 2015, despite the supplier having failed pre-qualification technical requirements for the supply of coal to &#8220;Z&#8221; (Majuba) Power Station. It further appears that the condition precedent of a successful combustion test was not met. Notwithstanding this, Eskom continued to implement the agreement with &#8220;A Co&#8221; Tegeta.
