PRETORIA &#8211; South Africa aims to save R16 billion ($1 billion) this year through better procurement practices, a senior Treasury official said on Monday, as the government reins in spending amid sluggish growth.Spending cuts have become increasingly significant for South Africa as it aims to cut its budget deficit to 2.6% of national output by 2019/20 from 3.4% now.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy spends close to R600 billion annually on goods and services, and inefficiency was a big concern in the procurement processes, the acting head of the Treasury&#8217;s procurement unit Schalk Human said.&#8220;Last year we managed to renegotiate the top 100 contracts of government and we saved R7 billion. This year we have initiated projects to save an additional R16 billion,&#8221; Human told Reuters.&#8220;Our aim is to save R25 billion per annum through better procurement practices that would deal with waste, corruption and fraud.&#8221;The chief procurement office was established in 2013 to rein in leakages in public expenditure and ensure that the government realises maximum value on its annual procurement budget.Human said practices that had led to wasteful spending include, among others, deviation from competitive tender processes, overpricing by suppliers and government departments buying more goods than needed.&#8220;If you buy in quantities that you are not going to utilise and it goes to rot, it goes to expiry, that is unforgivable,&#8221; Human said.The Treasury forecast 2017 economic growth of just 1.3%, up from 0.3% in 2016 but still well below the government&#8217;s 5% target.($1 = R12.9884)
