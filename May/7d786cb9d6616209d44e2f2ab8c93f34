Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Oil jumpsA barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was trading more than a dollar higher at $49.05 by 5:21am Eastern Time. The jump comes after Saudi Arabia and Russia said at a joint press conference in Beijing that they favour prolonging curbs on the output of global producers through the end of the first quarter of 2018. Also in China, Wang Yilin, chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation, said the country will import more crude oil and natural gas from the US. RansomwareThe cyber-attack which breached systems across the planet and forced UK hospitals to turn away patients on Friday is continuing to claim victims as people switch on their computers after the weekend. In the US, President Donald Trump asked his homeland security adviser to convene two emergency meetings on the threat posed by the hack. Merkel victoryGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s Christian Democratic Union had an unexpectedly strong victory in elections in the country&#8217;s most populous region yesterday. Her party took 34% of the vote, with the rival SPD taking less than 31%, its worst showing since World War II. The win is a boost for Merkel ahead of September&#8217;s federal election. Also yesterday, Emmanuel Macron became the youngest ever president of France, promising to bring back the country&#8217;s self-confidence. Markets little changedOvernight, the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index gained 0.3%, while Japan&#8217;s Topix Index closed broadly unchanged. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.2% lower at 5:45am as gains for miners and energy producers were offset by losses for drugmakers. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat. UK steps up battle with EUBritain&#8217;s Brexit Secretary David Davis rejected key EU demands on both the sequencing of exit negotiations and the rights of European citizens living in the UK. The hardline stance could be a political move to paint the EU as the &#8216;bad guy&#8217; during the current election campaign. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, meanwhile, agreed to purchase an office building in Dublin which will be able to accommodate more than 1 000 workers, which a spokesperson said would give the bank &#8220;some flexibility within the European Union. 2017 Bloomberg
