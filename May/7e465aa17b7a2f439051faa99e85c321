JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South African Weather Service said on Thursday an El Ni o weather pattern, which brought a scorching drought to southern Africa last year, could return in the spring or summer season which usually occurs from September to October.&#8220;Currently there is an expectation that an El Ni o event would occur during the next spring or summer seasons,&#8217; the weather service said in its monthly forecast. &#8220;The next outlook for spring or summer is not favourable with regards to rainfall and the public is reminded that if El Ni o does occur and exert its usual impact, the country might once again be put under strain with regards to water resources.&#8221;
