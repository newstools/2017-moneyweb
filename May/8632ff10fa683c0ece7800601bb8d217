The apparent suicide-bomber targeted the Manchester Arena after a concert by pop star Ariana Grande, who&#8217;s popular with teenagers and children. President Donald Trump sent his condolences, saying terrorists are &#8220;evil losers.&#8221;Budget proposalDonald Trump&#8217;s budget proposal would see a dramatic reduction in the federal government&#8217;s role in society, with a proposed $3.6 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. The plan, which would slash Medicaid payments and cut agricultural subsidies, has been declared dead on arrival by Republicans in Congress as it attacks too many powerful lobbies. The White House&#8217;s plan to trim national debt includes selling off half of the nation&#8217;s Strategic Petroleum Reserve and allowing drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, moves which would again face stiff opposition. The president, meanwhile, is continuing his tour of the Middle East, visiting Palestine today.
