A vote of no confidence would be, in the ANC s logic, a dangerous thing, as it could create serious intra-party conflict and an inability to regroup. ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said that while the agenda will only be set at the meeting, the committee won t discuss Zuma s removal.The Constitutional Court is considering whether to agree to an opposition party call for a secret ballot on the no-confidence motion in Zuma.The chances of Zuma being recalled remain low, Peter Attard Montalto, a London-based economist at Nomura International, said by email. We expect actually the NEC meeting this weekend to send a formal instruction to the National Assembly caucus to not vote for the no-confidence motion regardless of the secret ballot case outcome, he said.Zuma is due to step down as ANC leader in December and as president in 2019. His term has been marred by a succession of scandals, including a finding by the nation s top court that he violated his oath of office by refusing to repay taxpayer money spent on his private home. Labour unions and the South African Communist Party, which form part of the country s ruling coalition, have called for his replacement. The NEC can force Zuma to stop being president of the country, but not of the ANC as this can only be done at an electoral conference, Butler said. 2017 Bloomberg
