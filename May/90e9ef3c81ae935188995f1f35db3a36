The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) will announce a policy decision on Thursday as uncertainty around the Moody&#8217;s rating review hangs in the air. According to Tinyiko Ngwenya, an economist for Old Mutual Investment Group, the Sarb will likely leave the repo rate unchanged. In the previous policy meeting, the Sarb s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) did allude to the fact that they were at the end of the hiking cycle and that the major risk to them was the rand.&#8220;However, if they were to ease rates before the Moody s rating review, in the event that the review then comes back with a two notch downgrade to sub-investment grade, the rand would be negatively affected, which would ultimately change the MPC s trajectory. Political uncertainty further complicates this outlook and supports the view that rates will remain unchanged for the time being, says Ngwenya. At this stage, inflation is coming down and growth is recovering from last year s lacklustre growth, so we are seeing some progress in the economy. However, political uncertainty is expected to remain high especially leading up to the ANC Elective Conference set to take place in December. Initially, Nomura Group highlighted the risk of a hike at the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting as a result of the cabinet reshuffle and downgrades. But it issued a note on Monday, which said that the CPI inflation outlook and inflation expectations had not shifted markedly and that the MPC will view no specific reshuffle or forex-related reasons to hike.Touching on implications for the rest of the market should the Sarb cut the repo rate Zain Wilson, analyst for the Old Mutual Balanced Fund, said: The bond market should rally given that they re not expecting much whereas banks, retailers and property would all benefit from the cut. On the other hand, in the unlikely event of a hike, the bond market appears quite sensitive and would be expected to sell off.&#8221;
