Earnings estimates for South African stocks are at their highest ever, as analysts expect a major recovery in mining companies profits following a global rally in commodity prices in the past year. For the first time in 5 years, there s a good commodity cycle and the mining earnings were so depressed a year ago that they are coming off such a low base that they are shooting the lights out, Wayne McCurrie, head of portfolio management at Ashburton Investments, said by phone from Johannesburg. The answer fundamentally is mining companies &#8211; there s a massive turnaround in commodity share earnings. It s got little to do with South Africa; iron ore has gone from $20 to $60, and that s why they re making money. Earnings estimates for companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange climbed to a record on May 9. The All Share index has gained 6.7% year-to-date. 2017 Bloomberg
