MARC ASHTON: Welcome to the Moneyweb business podcast. Today we are speaking sport sponsorship and I m speaking to Tobie Badenhorst, head of group sponsorship and cause marketing for Nedbank. Tobie, thanks very much for joining us.TOBIE BADENHORST: Thanks, Marc, thank you for having me on the show.MARC ASHTON: Let s start high level. There s obviously some quite furious competition for sponsorship rands from organisations such as Nedbank.What is the criteria that you prioritise when presented with a sponsorship opportunity?TOBIE BADENHORST: Well, first of all I think it s obviously important for sponsorships to serve a business requirement and perhaps looking at shifting brand perception and demonstrating a purpose. If you look at some of the trends globally, with the recent IEG Conference in Chicago, [sponsorship] needs to have a real purpose for good and for social activism.But in essence, the way we define our sponsor properties is first of all [by] looking at our business strategy. Second to that is obviously our brand strategy and what we need to deliver on, and then looking at our sponsorship opportunities and objectives for each of those properties accordingly.For example, to create and reinforce our brand reputation our image is quite important for us: [to] create company awareness, company goodwill and to build loyalty and affinity with a particular audience are some of the key differentiators for us as a brand. From a Nedbank perspective, being the green and caring bank, it s obviously important for us to show community involvement in the communities in which we operate. From a business perspective obviously the client service/hospitality component is also very important and from a retail perspective the direct sales and the sales component is obviously a critical element of the sponsorship wheel.Lastly, I would say to differentiate the brand. MARC ASHTON: It would be great to simply say the sponsors are doing this as a good deed, but the reality is there has to be some measurability for you as a sponsor. How do you, firstly, tackle the measurability and then get the buy-in from your own teams to actually be able to deliver on these metrics?TOBIE BADENHORST: I think measurement is a key component and if you haven t clearly defined the objectives up front, then you ll always come up short when you try and measure and put the numbers together at the back end of sponsorships. So it s so important to start off with the objectives and then look at the measurement tools.There are a number of metrics that you can use, but one of the key components is measuring the media awareness levels. If the objective stated clearly that you wanted to shift certain brand perceptions and measure awareness of your brand, then obviously that component would be critical in the way that the awareness that you ve generated through measurement values &#8211; such as the ones that we get from BMI Sport Info, obviously looking at the fees, looking at the leverage spend that we re putting behind the sponsorship. So there s a model that we use just on awareness levels.Subsequent to that there s a number of other metrics that we ve also had a look at in terms of how we evaluate from a brand perspective. &#8230;To give you a snapshot, for example the strategic criteria that we use is looking at the brand impact: is there a clear brand fit; look at the relationship impact: are we building relationships with priority audiences. So we use benchmarks for those and use a robot system to measure each of those elements.Sponsorship leverage: we look at is there room for significant leverage investment, are we enabling participation. So we ve actually created a scorecard that we use for all of our properties.Lastly, the financial health of your sponsorship: do we get media exposure versus spend levels, the cost, the affordability and obviously exchange rate exposure when we talk of things like Nedbank Gold Challenge and doing the European tour.So yes, sponsorships provide a qualitative and marketing tool and I think it s most effective. Obviously from an advertising perspective it s quite important that you make that distinction between the role that advertising plays and the role that sponsorships play in the broader marketing mix.Nedbank s flagship sport eventsMARC ASHTON: You mentioned golf as an example of one of the sports that Nedbank has been quite closely aligned with. You ve also done activation in the soccer sector as well. Take us through the sponsorships you really enjoy and the ones that deliver some real return on investment for you.TOBIE BADENHORST: Our two flagship sponsorships, as you ve mentioned, would be the Nedbank Gold Challenge, catering for the higher end of the market and then the Nedbank Cup, which is more centred around the rising middle market, which are the two core target audiences that we try to cater for.Starting with the Nedbank Golf Challenge, it s probably one of the longest-standing sponsorships in the country. This year will mark the 37th year of Nedbank s association with that event and I think we ve been a title sponsor since 1996.So it s done a great job for us and if you have a look at sponsor recall, brand awareness versus the types of properties and codes that brands are associated with, then Nedbank and the Nedbank Golf Challenge are ranked in the top three in the country as far as sponsor and brand recall is concerned for a specific sports property.So it s done a great job for us in terms of positioning the brand with our high-net-worth clients, also our corporate investment banking division and they use that as a platform to leverage the sponsorship.Then the Nedbank Cup. In 2008, prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when Nedbank brought on the retail division to the Nedbank brand they realised that they had to position themselves as being a bank for all South Africans &#8211; and what better way to do it than by utilising the biggest sport in the country, soccer.The Nedbank Cup has done a great job for us to position the Nedbank Brand, especially amongst the entry-level banking market.Since then we ve been able to measure the brand metrics accordingly to see what the awareness levels were in that market and as a second phase [we&#8217;re] now being able to reap the rewards from a retail component and giving back obviously to our clients, but to make sure that there s a real business benefit as a result of the sponsorship.MARC ASHTON: I have been quite actively involved in club sports, so I ve been on the other side: trying to source sponsorships, different types of sponsors either at a club level or a provincial level. I look at the US market and it s incredibly well developed and sophisticated in terms of the way varsity sport approaches sponsors, how the franchise system works and so on, but in South Africa we don t seem to share that same level of sophistication. I know that the best thing that can often be offered by a lot of the sports clubs, for instance, is stick a banner up next to our field or put a board next to our field.Any advice for the sports scene in terms of how they can make themselves more sophisticated and how they can get better returns for their sponsors and bring additional sponsors on board?TOBIE BADENHORST: Absolutely. If you look at some global best practice &#8211; and I ve been very fortunate to be able to attend Super Bowl XV last year in San Francisco, the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2012 Olympic Games in London &#8211; and the key thing is really centred around fan engagement and using digital marketing and social media as probably the best mediums to engage fans at these events.One of the things that s really noticeable is the use of event apps at all of these big global events and turning that platform into a level of gamification, whereby fans can earn points by engaging in certain activities or visiting certain sponsors stands or exhibitions and being able to earn points, which ultimately give them an opportunity to win prizes at the end of the day or stand a chance to win a VIP experience. So I think they do it really effectively and obviously first-world countries especially, and obviously the US.But from a South African perspective &#8230; obviously we need to catch up a bit as far as the use of digital market and social media is concerned, but I don t think we are really that far behind the rest. In some instances I think we ve been leading the pack, especially if you look at some of the innovations that we ve brought in. For example, if I look at what Carling Black Label did with the Black Label Cup in 2011, that s really been a global case study &#8211; and it s really done wonders for not only their brand, but to position South Africa.From a Nedbank perspective, [there was] the addition of the Nedbank Ke Yona Team Search by using USSD technology for potential soccer players between the ages of 18 and 23. [They] enter a competition whereby they would be selected and scouted by some of the best coaches in the country, trainers and professionals, and they come up against the Nedbank Cup champions of that specific year. So we re quite fortunate, just from the Nedbank Ke Yona Team perspective it s probably been one of the most successful marketing and sponsorship campaigns for the Nedbank brand.We ve won the best-integrated sports marketing campaign at the SA Sport Industry awards in 2015 and 2016, and even as far back as 2014 we won the category for best use of digital media at a sport event. If you look at what are the best mediums for brands to use to leverage their sponsorships, PR was still ranked number one as far as the BMI data is concerned last year.But [in] the rest of the world it s all social media and the rising importance of social media is quite evident. I think more and more brands will use that as the primary medium to engage fans at sports events.MARC ASHTON: Tobie, it s great to sign off on a positive note.
