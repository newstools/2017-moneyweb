South Africa&#8217;s central bank kept its benchmark repo rate steady at 7% on Thursday, as expected, citing concerns about the inflation outlook, even though it cut its growth forecasts.Governor Lesetja Kganyago said consumer inflation is now within the bank&#8217;s target of between 3% and 6%, but the longer-term Consumer Price Index trajectory was &#8220;uncomfortably close to the upper end&#8221; of the range.The rand firmed slightly in response to the rate decision, while government bonds weakened.Kganyago also said the outlook of the rand currency, in light of the domestic political uncertainty and credit ratings downgrades, remained a key risk to the inflation outlook.While factors suggest that inflation is becoming less of a concern, FNB chief economist Sizwe Nxedlana says renewed exchange rate weakness and elevated inflation expectations threaten this outlook. &#8220;A reduction in rates would be possible should inflation continue to surprise on the downside and the forecast over the policy horizon be sustainably within the target range,&#8221; Kganyago told a media conference in Pretoria.&#8220;However, in the current environment of high levels of uncertainty, the risks to the outlook could easily deteriorate, and derail the current favourable assessment.&#8221;&nbsp;Says Nxedlana: We continue to believe that the bank has reached the peak of the hiking cycle, and will wait for risks to lean more towards the downside before reducing the policy rate.&#8220;While portfolio flows into emerging markets continue to bode well for the currency, the sustainability of these portfolio flows remains uncertain. Given that the Fed is expected to continue gradually hiking rates; the pending balance sheet reduction could have negative implications for emerging markets. Furthermore, event risks locally remain as we head into the ANC elective conference and await S&amp;P and Moody s sovereign rating reviews.&#8221;S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch downgraded South Africa to &#8220;junk&#8221; in April after a cabinet reshuffle at the end of March in which Pravin Gordhan, widely respected by markets, was fired as finance minister.Moody&#8217;s put South Africa on review for a downgrade.

Domestic economic growth prospects have deteriorated, as the impact of the ratings downgrades is expected to weigh on domestic investment and consumer sentiment &#8230; However the trajectory of the growth forecast is still positive.&#8221;Bank has revised GDP growth downwards for 2017 &amp; 2018 both by 0.2%to 1.0% &amp; 1.5% respectively. 2019, forecast is 0.3% lower at 1.7% pic.twitter.com/B4WjiWkugV&mdash; SA Reserve Bank (@SAReserveBank) May 25, 2017Inflation&#8220;While the inflation outlook has improved over the near term, the longer term trajectory is unchanged and uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range.&#8221;Rand&#8220;The rand exchange rate and domestic bond yields benefited from increased global capital flows to emerging markets which largely offset the impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade. &#8220;With further ratings decisions imminent, risks remain for a further depreciation against the backdrop of continued global and domestic political uncertainty.&#8221; Food prices&#8220;A continued moderation of food prices is expected over the medium term given the favourable agricultural outlook and the significant upward revisions to the maize crop estimates.&#8221;Wage increases&#8220;Nominal salary and wage increases have continued to show signs of significant moderation, but are still at levels that contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels.&#8221;Current account&#8220;A moderately wider current account deficit is expected over the forecast period, due in part to a recent deterioration in the terms of trade.&#8221; Decision&#8220;The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced&#8230; The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0 percent per annum.&#8220;The MPC remains of the view that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate for now and that we are likely at the end of the tightening cycle.&#8220;Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction.&#8221; (Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana and TJ Strydom; Editing by Ed Cropley)Read Kganyago&#8217;s full statement here.
