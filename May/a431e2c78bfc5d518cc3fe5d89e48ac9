PRETORIA &#8211; The Sarb is concerned about further downgrades to local currency debt and the impact on the stability of the domestic financial system, it said in a report on Tuesday.Africa&#8217;s most industrialised economy has this year suffered from credit ratings downgrades after President Jacob Zuma sacked respected Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in late March.&#8220;The possibility of further downgrades to South Africa&#8217;s local currency rating and South Africa consequently being excluded from the remaining bond indices is disconcerting,&#8221; the bank said in a financial stability review.The regulator added that should ratings agencies downgrade South African local currency debt further it could have a significant impact on the cost of funding and investment flows.&#8220;Market volatility could increase as a result, with sharp losses likely to be recorded in the currency, bond and equity markets, thereby negatively affecting the stability of the domestic financial system,&#8221; it said.S&amp;P Global Ratings cut South African foreign debt to sub-investment grade in April, while Fitch downgraded both the foreign and local currency debt to &#8220;junk&#8221; status.Moody&#8217;s, two notches above junk status, has put South Africa on review for a downgrade.Local currency borrowing makes up about 90 percent of the South Africa&#8217;s total 2.2 trillion rand of debt.
