Investment managers in South Africa lag the country s five retail banks when it comes to employment equity. In its submission to parliament s hearings on transformation in the financial services sector, the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (Asisa) showed the industry is far behind targets on three measures: the number of black executive directors, the number of black people in senior management positions and the number of black middle managers. More needs to be done on even the number of black professionals in junior management positions, an area where the country s banks (mostly) exceed the current target.&nbsp;Actual 2005Actual 2015Target 2015SA black ownership16%31%25%Management and Control&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black board members30%43%50%Black executive directors22%39%50%Black top managementN/A39%40%Employment Equity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black senior management16%34%60%Black middle management32%45%75%Black junior management45%67%80%* Source: AsisaThese statistics, presented by Asisa chair Thabo Dloti, are based on the draft 2015 Financial Sector Charter Council report. That this is still not published and that these (at least) 18-month-old statistics were presented to parliament is an indictment on the sector. Asisa s submission states the rather obvious fact that some members will have performed better and some worse than the industry scores . It is also not yet clear which institutions provided data to the council for this report. In 2013, only eight out of 75 asset management companies, which were members of the council, provided data.On employment equity measures, i.e. the number of black managers in junior, middle and senior ranks, the asset management industry trails all the retail banks but one (Capitec) (see Where banks fail (and win) on transformation). But, Capitec outperforms the investment management industry on the junior management score. Where asset managers do outperform banks is on the amount of black executive directors and top management. Here, only Nedbank fares better (at 54%), versus the industry average for money managers of 39%. Obviously the size difference of the two sectors makes them impossible to compare directly (Coronation, for example, has 286 permanent staff in South Africa, versus the 13 000 at Capitec and 30 000-40 000 at the four other banks).Coronation, the largest asset manager in the country, has done far better than most peers when it comes to transformation. In its annual results presentation in November last year, chief executive Anton Pillay made the point that the business had achieved meaningful and sustainable transformation . Three of its four exco members are black, and more than half its total staff complement in South Africa are black, of which more than 60% are female .Coronation also says that its SA-focused investment team has transformed materially over the past decade . As at the end of September 2016, 43% of senior portfolio managers in the team were black, while three out of four leadership roles were filled by black investment professionals (head of Fixed Income, head of SA Equity, head of SA Equity Research).In its 2016 annual report, Coronation says that &#8220;transformation is a business imperative which makes practical business sense, the benefits of which extend to clients, partners, shareholders, employees and the South African economy&#8221;.Old Mutual Investment Group s representation of black employees in management (as at June 2016) was: 36% senior managers, 66% middle managers and 77% junior managers. This is also significantly above the industry average as reported by Asisa.Sygnia notes in its 2016 annual report that 51% of its (175) staff are black, and 54% are female. During the 2016 financial year, both these measures exceeded 50% for the first time.The 2015 review on transformation of the financial sector in South Africa will make for interesting reading when it is finally published. One hopes, however, that a far broader list of asset managers provided data to the council this time round. One could hardly assume that Allan Gray, Cadiz, Coronation, Investec Asset Management, Maitland Group, Prudential, TriAlpha and Vunani (those who provided data for the 2013 report) are representative of the entire market.Perhaps Asisa itself could draw on the work already being done by its Transformation, Skills Development and Education Board Committee and produce authoritative research on the industry? After all, it represents a sector that manages nearly R10 trillion in unit trust savings, retirement savings and life offices.&nbsp;Ownership (14 points)Management and Control (8 points)Employment Equity (15 points)B-BBEE StatusInvestec Limited (incl.
