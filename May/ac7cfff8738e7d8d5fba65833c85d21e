The Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) and My Vote Counts NPC (MVC) have approached the Constitutional Court for relief against President Jacob Zuma and the National Assembly. The two organisations have filed papers in the Constitutional Court this morning to: The relief builds on the finding in the case the Economic Freedom Fighters brought against the president over the Nkandla matter, wherein it was found he violated his oath of office. The National Assembly, in our opinion, has failed to do their job in holding the president to account and we want them compelled to do so, says Helen Suzman Foundation director, Francis Antonie.The foundation reiterates the president s powers are the creation of the constitution and as such, all of his decisions must be scrutinised and reviewed.
