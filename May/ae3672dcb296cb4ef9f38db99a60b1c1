JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand set a 3-1/2-week low against the dollar in early trade on Friday as an oil price slide hit commodity currencies, while investors moved to safe haven assets as risk sentiment wavered.At 0714 GMT, the rand traded at 13.6950 per dollar, a level last seen on April 12, 0.37% weaker from its New York close on Wednesday.Oil slumped to five-month lows on Thursday amid record trading volume in Brent crude, as the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers appeared to rule out deeper supply cuts to reduce the world&#8217;s persistent glut of crude.&#8220;The general rand weakness continued almost unabated yesterday as commodity prices took their toll on those currencies who have a strong fundamental association to them,&#8221; said Standard Bank trader Warrick Butler.&#8220;So even though we weren&#8217;t the only country to suffer a loss of currency value yesterday the exiting of long rand positions is likely to continue.&#8221;Investors are also awaiting Friday&#8217;s US non-farm payrolls report for additional insight into the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rate likely trajectory through the end of the year.Stocks were set to open lower at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 futures index down 0.32%.The yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 5.5 basis points to 8.76%.
