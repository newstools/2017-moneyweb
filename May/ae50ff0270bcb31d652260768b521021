The chairman of state-run South African power utility Eskom said on Thursday that plans unveiled in March to decommission five coal-fired power station were not set in stone and could be shelved depending on economic growth and other factors.South Africa is diversifying its energy mix away from an over-reliance on coal-power plants to include greener wind and solar projects.South Africa&#8217;s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and other unions have threatened strike action over the proposals, which would threaten thousands of jobs in the coal-producing eastern province of Mpumalanga.&#8220;It is a scenario. If we put in a certain amount of independent power producers (IPPs) then we reduce the capacity space for these power stations. That would result in mothballing,&#8221; Eskom Chairman Ben Ngubane told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Africa in Durban.But he said if the pace of adding IPP projects to the grid did not take place as quickly as anticipated, or if economic growth which has been flatlining picked up, then the plants would not be shut down.There is uncertainty over the rollout of IPPs, which would mostly involve renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.Industry experts have said that Eskom slowed the pace of agreeing new renewable energy contracts after power supply in South Africa stabilized last year, following shortages in 2015 that led to rolling power cuts known locally as &#8220;load shedding.&#8221;Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi said on Tuesday that power shortages could return in three to four years.But Ngubane said this would be averted if Eskom stuck to its maintenance projects on its ageing plants.&#8220;If we carry on with the maintenance plans then there should not be any danger of load shedding. But if we neglect maintenance then we shall be playing with fire,&#8221; he said.
