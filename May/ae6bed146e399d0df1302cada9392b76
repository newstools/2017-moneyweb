US stocks were little changed in late morning trading on Friday, following six straight days of gains, as investors took a breather ahead of a three-day holiday weekend.A strong batch of earnings reports from retailers drove the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to a record close on Thursday, putting all three major indexes on track to post their strongest weekly gains since the end of April.The six-day winning streak is the market&#8217;s longest since February and investors may look to cash in on their gains ahead of the long weekend due to Monday&#8217;s Memorial Day holiday.Earlier in the day, a report showed that the US economy grew at a 1.2% pace in the first quarter, slightly more than the 0.7% growth estimated earlier. The higher reading was in line with economists&#8217; expectations.&#8220;US markets are generally flat this morning as we see a stronger revision to the first-quarter GDP data and better-than-expected durable goods orders,&#8221; said Emily Roland, head of investment research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.&#8220;We&#8217;ve reached new highs and we expect days of strong gains. Investors may be taking a breather as we head into the holiday weekend.&#8221;At 10:57am ET (1457 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.5 points, or 0.06%, at 21 070.45 and the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.26 points, or 0.01%, at 2,414.81.However, the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.73 points, or 0.06%, at 6 208.99.Consumer stocks had another strong day, with the consumer staples index rising 0.23% and topping the list of gainers.
