Apple Inc became the first U.S. company to top the $800 billion mark in market capitalisation on Tuesday, slightly more than two years after it crossed the $700 billion threshold.The iPhone maker&#8217;s shares have gained 33% this year and almost 50% since the U.S. election in November. The company represents about 4% of the $21.7 trillion that makes up the entire S&amp;P 500 index.Apple accounted for as much as 4.9% of the S&amp;P 500 in September 2012 but is a smaller percentage now as the index as a whole has rallied more than 7% this year.&#8220;It&#8217;s just reflective of how powerful a franchise it is. It may be the most powerful franchise in the country today,&#8221; said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey, whose firm does not own the stock.&#8220;Considering that it has a limited number of products, it has really dominated that market in a way that few companies have, and it&#8217;s been able to retain margins despite lots of competitors.&#8221;If Apple continues on its growth path, the company will top the $1 trillion market cap level later this year.Stock buybacks have also bolstered Apple shares, with the company reducing its actual share count by 20.9% and the average diluted shares outstanding by 20.5% over the past four years, according to Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s data.The median price target on Apple is $160, up from the $140 median three months ago. Shares closed at $153.99 on Tuesday.The closing market cap of $802.8 billion was larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 U.S. states, topped only by Illinois, Florida, New York, Texas and California.Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a stake of roughly $20 billion in Apple, said on Monday he had grown more fond of the company because he could &#8220;very easily determine&#8221; the iPhone maker&#8217;s competitive position &#8220;and who is trying to chase them.&#8221;
