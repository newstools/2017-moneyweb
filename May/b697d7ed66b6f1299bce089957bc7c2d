JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s rand raced to a three-week high on Tuesday as the dollar was knocked back by another batch of disappointing data, allowing the local currency to cross a technical milestone that could open the door to further gains.At 0717 GMT the rand was 0.68% firmer at 13.0900 per dollar, its strongest level since April 26 with bulls pouncing on the breach of 13.25 resistance mark to add impetus to a rally that started last week.Firming commodity prices also supported rand gains, with spot gold gaining 0.3% and platinum up 0.1% to a two-week high.Technical and momentum indicators favour continued rally, with implied volatility on the currency at the lowest since March. Next target at 13.00, but traders say some selling into the rally by exporters could limit gains.&#8220;The rand has a well deserved higher beta than other EM currencies and so it strengthened a little more than its peers,&#8221; said currency strategist at Standard Bank Warrick Butler.Stocks opened lower 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange&#8217;s Top-40 index down 0.3% at 47 307 points.Bonds firmed, with the yield for the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 2 basis points to 8.665%.
