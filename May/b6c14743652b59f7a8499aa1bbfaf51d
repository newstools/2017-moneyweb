Dissenters in the face of the relentless emerging-market rally are speaking out.A drop in oil prices and China s crackdown on leverage &#8212; spurring this month s rout in industrial metals and iron ore &#8212; is setting the stage for a correction in developing-country assets, according to a growing chorus of investors and analysts. While still in the minority, they warn a tide of capital inflows and a jump in bullish positions have left valuations at an inflated level after gains in emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies this year.Global markets have largely shrugged off Beijing s move to tighten the credit spigot &#8212; which has sparked a rout in domestic stocks and bonds &#8212; driven by sanguine projections over the outlook for China s output, exchange rate and capital account. But bears say that investors are discounting the risk that the reduction in leverage will slow growth in other developing nations as well.&#8220;Sell the strength,&#8221; said Arthur Budaghyan, a strategist at Montreal-based BCA Research. &#8220;When the rally cracks in the weeks ahead, investors should establish short positions because the potential downside will be considerable.&#8221;The extra yield investors demand to hold emerging-market sovereign debt instead of Treasuries has tumbled over the past month, while inflows to equity and bond funds have gathered steam. Investors put more than $2.5 billion in emerging-market bond funds in the week to May 3, a 14th week of net gains, according to consultancy EPFR Global, while equity funds took in $2.4 billion last week, the seventh consecutive week of inflows.&#8220;Flows have been rotating out of U.S. high-yield debt and into emerging markets, which has papered over the vulnerability of emerging markets to higher rates, a stronger dollar and weaker commodities,&#8221; said Ed Al-Hussainy, a senior analyst on Columbia Threadneedle Investment s global rates and currency team.For now, bulls are firmly in charge. On Monday, DoubleLine Capital s Jeffrey Gundlach was the latest investor to tout the trade, with a call to short the S&amp;P 500 Index and go long the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund, which has returned 16 percent this year. The bullish positioning is effectively a bet on stability in China: Over a quarter of the benchmark EM ETF is weighted to either Chinese-domiciled companies or those based in Hong Kong, according to Bespoke Investment Group.From South Africa to Chile, currencies of resource-rich nations are snubbing weak commodity prices, as implied by weak 30-day correlations. That s a sign, for some, of investor complacency. Only Russia s ruble has experienced an uptick in its ties to oil, notching a four-month high of 0.53. A correlation of 1 suggests assets are moving perfectly in lock step.Equity investors are also expressing pronounced apathy over commodity-price risks. The four-month performance of emerging-market equities, adjusted for volatility, relative to commodities is near record highs. And investors overweight positions are at the highest level in five years, according to Bank of America Corp. s monthly survey of fund managers. Strategists at the US bank recommend investors snap up put options as cheap bets on an uptick in developing-country stock volatility.&#8220;EM will temporarily struggle with the twin drag of lower commodity prices and China deleveraging policy,&#8221; says Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. A stronger selloff in commodities could also be the catalyst to undo the emerging-market momentum. If the Bloomberg Commodity Index hits a key technical level of 81.9555, less than 1 percent from current levels, it could quickly tumble as much as 9 percent more, spurred by softer data from China, according to Rabobank emerging-markets currency strategist Piotr Matys.&#8220;A break below this key trendline support could unleash carnage,&#8221; he said.Al-Hussainy reckons high interest rates in Brazil and Russia still offer investors compensation for currency risk, and is underweight debt issued by single-B and C-rated sovereigns after a six-month rally. UBS Group AG prefers Asian markets over eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and local-currency bonds on a currency-hedged basis, but warn these trades now have limited upside.&#8220;We think the EM equity trade likely gives way before the bond trade does,&#8221; strategists Bhanu Baweja and Manik Narain wrote in a note.To be sure, technical factors also account, in part, for recent weakness in commodity prices, current-account positions among the fragile five bloc are strengthening, and investors are banking on relative stability in China ahead of the Communist Party s leadership gathering this fall. But, at some point, markets may have to price in risks to the emerging market business cycle posed from China.&#8220;I still think that the wide output gaps in some commodity exporters will lead to continued inflows, especially to local bonds,&#8221; said Rachel Ziemba, the New York-based head of emerging markets at 4CAST-RGE. &#8220;However, if China keeps tightening, it s not going to be pretty.&#8221; 2017 Bloomberg LP
