ArcelorMittal South Africa has secured a R4.5 billion revolving credit facility to finance its working capital requirements, the firm said on Wednesday.The steelmaker, a unit of ArcelorMittal, has had to cut costs after a drop in steel sales, and has long complained that cheap imports eat into its market.&#8220;&#8230;a revolving structured commodity trade finance facility has now been concluded by ArcelorMittal South Africa and its subsidiary, Saldanha Steel with Deutsche Bank, Absa Bank (Barclays Africa Group) and other lenders,&#8221; said Chief Executive Wim de Klerk in a statement.South Africa last month said it plans to put emergency &#8220;safeguard&#8221; tariffs on imports of certain flat hot-rolled steel products from July after domestic production had suffered serious damage from an unforeseen surge in imports.The tariff would be in place for three years, and fall from 12% in the first year to 10 percent in the second year and 8% in the third, South Africa said in a filing to the World Trade Organisation.ArcelorMittal South Africa said the R4.5 billion facility will have a 36-month tenor.
