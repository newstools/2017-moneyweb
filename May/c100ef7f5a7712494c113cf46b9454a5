Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Hung parliament?The pound fell to the lowest level in more than five weeks after a projection by Yougov, a UK polling company, showed that Theresa May&#8217;s Conservative Party may fall short of winning a majority in Parliament in the June 8 election. The projection, which is based on a new methodology, is out of step with other polls that continue to show a solid Conservative lead. It does, however, have people more seriously addressing the question of what it would take for Labour&#8217;s Jeremy Corbyn to win the election. Euro dataEuro-area inflation slowed to 1.4% in May, slightly below economist expectations, and the weakest reading this year. Core inflation dropped to 0.9%. The numbers are likely to aid ECB president Mario Draghi&#8217;s call for continued accommodative monetary policy ahead of next week&#8217;s governing council meeting. Meanwhile, unemployment data for the common-currency zone showed a drop to 9.3%, the lowest level since March 2009. No China slowdownOfficial manufacturing data released overnight showed that growth in China is holding up, despite worries that a leverage crackdown would feed through to investment in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2%, paring its monthly loss to 1.2%. One place that the deleveraging campaign is apparent, however, is in the government bond market, with the nation&#8217;s 10-year security falling for the second month in a row. Markets quietOvernight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed, while Japan&#8217;s Topix index slipped 0.3% with energy companies leading the losses. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was unchanged at 5:48am Eastern Time, with London&#8217;s FTSE 100 Index gaining on the back of the drop in the pound. S&amp;P 500 futures were also unchanged. Coming up&#8230;It is a fairly light day for US data today, with Chicago PMI due at 9:45am and pending home sales at 10:00am. It will be worth keeping an eye on Brazil, where the central bank is expected to cut the main Selic rate by 100 basis points. Also due today is a European Commission report into the future of the monetary union, which may suggest the need to issue collective bonds. 2017 Bloomberg
