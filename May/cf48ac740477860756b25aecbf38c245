Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.Trump leaks?White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster rejected the conclusions of a Washington Post article which claimed the president had revealed sensitive classified information to Russia&#8217;s top diplomat during an Oval Office meeting last week. The story &#8220;as reported is false, he said. The alleged leak is more bad news for President Donald Trump, who was already under pressure over the firing of FBI director James Comey. The dollar dropped for a fifth day in the aftermath of the Post article, with the euro rising to $1.1044 by 5:37am Eastern Time. UK inflationConsumer prices rose 2.7% in April from a year earlier, their highest reading since September 2013. While the pound initially rallied on the higher-than-expected figure, as it reduces the chance of further easing from the Bank of England, the currency was trading lower for the session at $1.2886 by 5:41am. The number adds to Governor Mark Carney&#8217;s difficulties after a report yesterday suggested that the UK labour market is facing a &#8220;rockier&#8221; future. Oil holds gainsA barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was trading at $49.13 by 5:45am as confidence increased that other oil-exporting nations would follow the Russian and Saudi proposal for extending production cuts. Should an agreement be reached next week to prolong the cuts through the end of the first quarter of 2018, that would be enough to erase the glut weighing on prices, according to Bloomberg calculations using US government data.Markets mixedOvernight, the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index gained 0.1%, while Japan&#8217;s Topix Index added 0.3%, with the Nikkei 225 coming within 2 points of 20 000 during the session. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.3% lower at 5:50am after disappointing car-sales data hit automakers. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat. Coming up&#8230;Later today President Donald Trump will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with Trump&#8217;s decision to arm Kurdish groups against the Islamic State in Syria stoking tensions between the NATO allies. At 9:15am industrial production data for the US is released, with the manufacturing component expected to show 0.3% growth. 2017 Bloomberg
