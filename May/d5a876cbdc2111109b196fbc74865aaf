JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has tabled wage hike demands of 12.5% to 16% with Anglo American&#8217;s unit Kumba Iron Ore, well above inflation, according to a document obtained by Reuters on Thursday.Anglo American has signalled its intention to sell off its stake in Kumba and the talks could be tough as prospective investors will not want to be saddled with an onerous wage bill amid uncertainty about iron and steel prices.Kumba said earlier in May that it expects its interim earnings to rise by at least 20%, largely because of higher export prices for iron ore which have been boosted by weakness in the rand currency.The wage demands call for a 16% increase for the lowest-paid category of workers or a monthly increase of just over R1 300. The highest-paid NUM members at Kumba are seeking a 12.5% raise or almost R2 600 a month.Wage demands in recent years have been driven by sharply higher food prices triggered by a 2015-16 drought and inflation more widely.But annual inflation slowed to 5.3% in April from 6.1% in March as food price rises slowed, Statistics Africa data showed on Wednesday, beating market expectations of a 5.55% year-on-year print.
