Brazilian President Michel Temer is struggling to suppress a revolt in his own party by lawmakers who want him to resign after last week s damaging graft allegations.The best solution to remove Temer, who is being investigated by the prosecutor-general on corruption and cover-up charges, is for the top electoral court to annul the 2014 election result in which he shared a ticket with ousted President Dilma Rousseff, according to half a dozen legislators from his ruling PMDB party who spoke to Bloomberg News. The court will retake the case on alleged illegal campaign financing on June 6.In an effort to squash the dissidents, Temer called an emergency meeting with PMDB Senators on Wednesday morning, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named. Separately, the largest member in Temer s allied base, the PSDB, will meet hours later to discuss its future in the coalition.The president s press office wasn t immediately able to comment, though the meeting with PMDB Senators is on Temer s official agenda. The nation was rocked last week by news of a Supreme Court-authorised probe into Temer on allegations of passive corruption and obstruction of justice, only days before Congress had planned to vote on a pension bill considered central to the administration s efforts to fix the country s depleted public coffers and pull its economy out of recession.Some of the dissident lawmakers told Bloomberg News that they favor a negotiated resignation in which Temer agrees to not stall possible court decisions against him with appeals. Senator Renan Calheiros, the current leader of Temer s PMDB party in the upper house, has become the most outspoken advocate of a &#8220;negotiated exit&#8221; for Temer.Yet Temer, a 76 year-old career politician, refuses to budge, saying charges against him were trumped up and the evidence doctored.Also he told a group of lower house legislators Tuesday night that Brazil s economic recovery was at stake if lawmakers abandoned him now, according to people present at the meeting. Two of the government s main proposals are deregulating the labor market and capping pension spending. Tens of thousands of people protested against both proposals at a demonstration on Wednesday in Brasilia organised by labour unions.Possible substitutes?Another factor that buys Temer time is the lack of consensus on a possible substitute. Under the current law, Congress would elect an interim leader until the October 2018 general elections, should Temer leave office.Some of the names discussed in the halls and elevators of Congress s modernist building in Brasilia include Senator Tasso Jereissati of the PSDB party, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Nelson Jobim, ex-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and current Supreme Court Chief Justice Carmen Lucia Rocha. Also the current head of the lower house, Rodrigo Maia, was suggested by senior legislators as an alternative.In order to help rebuild support among legislators and their constituents, Temer is pushing a series of pork barrel projects, such as wage increases for public tax collectors, debt refinancing for small and mid-size companies, as well as land ordinance regulations sought by farmers, according to a person with direct access to the president who asked not to be named. 2017 Bloomberg
