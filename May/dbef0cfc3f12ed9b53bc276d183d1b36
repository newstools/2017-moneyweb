Thabo Dloti has resigned as chief executive of Liberty Holdings with immediate effect, following a difference with the board. Thabo is leaving Liberty following a difference of opinion with the board on the immediate focus of the company at a time when the organisation is facing tough operational and environmental challenges.Thabo believes that given this environment, alignment amongst key stakeholders is imperative to ensure the effective execution of the strategy required to drive the company forward. This alignment coupled with the ability to act decisively is in the best interests of the company and hence Thabo is stepping aside, Liberty said in Sens announcement. Dloti, the former chief executive of Stanlib, took the reins from Bruce Hemphill in 2014.Liberty s financial performance, under Dloti, has been impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions and heightened strain on consumers across the territories in which it operates. The group reported a 46.2% decline in headline earnings to R2.21 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016. The group announced that David Munro, chief executive of Standard Bank Group s Corporate &amp; Investment Banking (CIB) division and non-executive director of Liberty Holdings, will replace Dloti effective immediately.In a separate Sens announcement, Standard Bank said CIB s deputy chief executive Kenny Fihla would assume the chief executive role.Standard Bank previously said it had devised a detailed action plan to turnaround subsidiary Liberty. Sim Tshabalala, chief executive of Standard Bank, today affirmed the group s support of Liberty. Given Liberty s importance as an institution to the Standard Bank Group, our ongoing priority is to enable the company to achieve its growth by focusing on a short-term recovery plan and a longer-term strategy to reinforce its competitiveness. Liberty remains a fundamentally sound business and Standard Bank is confident of Liberty s long-term profitability, competitiveness and sustainability, he said.
