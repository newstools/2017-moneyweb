Rocket said the valuation was in line with previous valuation rounds, without specifying further.Berlin-based Delivery Hero, founded in 2011 and now operating across more than 40 countries, had said last month it could consider an initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital to bulk up and face competition from the likes of Uber.
