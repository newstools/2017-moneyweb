Struggling department chain Stuttafords has launched a slew of discounts and promotions as time is running out for the retailer to avoid the worst-case scenario of liquidation.The 159-year-old retailer has launched a mix of 50% discounts and three-for-two promotions on merchandise in a bid to lure customers back at its stores and contain bleeding sales.Stuttafords has ramped up promotions at some of its largest department stores including Johannesburg s Sandton City and Rosebank Mall, and Canal Walk Shopping Centre in Cape Town. The promotions come at a time when Stuttafords has to purchase merchandise for the winter season and clear old merchandise off the shelves.However, sources say Stuttafords has launched wide promotions because it has run out of money to purchase new merchandise. The much-needed proceeds from the discounted sales would alleviate its cash-crunch.Stuttafords placed itself into voluntary business rescue on October 28, buying it time from paying creditors collectively owed R836 million including Nedbank, Levi Strauss, L Or al SA, Tommy Hilfiger, Polo, Puma, Adidas, Est e Lauder and many others.Stuttafords business rescue practitioner John Evans says the retailer is moving older merchandise across its store network in SA. It owns nine department stores, 16 mono-brand stores (brands with stand-alone stores) and three stores outside SA (two in Botswana and one in Namibia). We need to make sure that we are maximising trading in May. If the stock doesn t clear then we need to find other funding methods in order to purchase next season stock, Evans tells Moneyweb.He says trading hasn t been fantastic in April as stores have been understocked.Stuttafords rescue plans hit a wall last month after SA s elite furniture family Ellerine Brothers aborted plans to feed R12 million into the retailer.An eleventh-hour salvo between the rescue practitioners and Ellerines emerged with the latter saying it was frustrated by its attempts to access Stuttafords financial records in order to determine whether it s capable of rescue. As it stands, Stuttafords has no solid rescue plan in place.

Creditors also accuse the retailer of not informing them about the retailer s discounting and promotions.Under previous versions of the rescue plan, creditors were asked to take a more than 70% write-off on the money due to them, continue supplying Stuttafords with merchandise on consignment or on 120 days credit terms.
