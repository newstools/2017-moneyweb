JOHANNESBURG &#8211; South Africa&#8217;s Tongaat Hulett expects a 45% rise in full-year earnings as its sugar production operations swing back to profit, the company said on Friday.A severe drought in southern Africa has weighed on agricultural production and constrained Tongaat&#8217;s sugar cane growing in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa.However, it said it expects headline earnings per share to rise to 852 cents from 588 cents in the year to end-March on higher market prices and increased import protection for sugar.Tongaat also produces starch, which it said was negatively impacted by higher drought-related maize costs.Sugar production edged up to 1.06 million tonnes from 1.02 million tonnes, Tongaat said in a statement.&#8220;The recovery from these poor growing conditions, with two years of regular growing conditions, is expected to result in sugar production exceeding 1.5 million tons,&#8221; Tongaat said.
