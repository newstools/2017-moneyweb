South African cabinet ministers on Wednesday ceded to pressure from senior politicians and the public by dismissing the head of state power utility Eskom, Brian Molefe, an ally of President Jacob Zuma who has been accused of mismanagement.Opposition parties and some members of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) heavily criticised the decision to reinstate Molefe two weeks ago, given he resigned last year amid allegations of graft in the award of Eskom contracts.Molefe denies any wrongdoing and said he resigned in the interest of good governance and stability.An inter-ministerial committee (IMC) said it was &#8220;in the best interests of government, Eskom and the country&#8221; for Eskom to rescind the decision to bring back Molefe. An interim chief executive officer would be chosen within 48 hours, it said.&nbsp;As to what will happen to contracts Molefe may have signed while in the post most recently, Brown said she would know once having spoken to the board today, although they may not yet know either. The same applies to any salary pertaining to Molefe. The IMC s (inter-ministerial committee&#8217;s) view is that the decision [to reappoint Molefe] should not have happened. It s caused government a lot of harm, a lot of reputational damage (which extends to Eskom), said finance minister Malusi Gigaba. Sitting where I sit, I would not have wanted this decision to be taken in the first place not only given the ratings agencies .We should act correctly because these are public entities . Finance Minister Malusi #Gigaba says the #BrianMolefe reappointment should have been handled differently in the best interest of the country pic.twitter.com/S3Juc6zV2s&mdash; SA Gov News (@SAgovnews) May 31, 2017&nbsp;Gigaba added that the decision to rescind Molefe was not a reflection on his capabilities or lack thereof, as &#8220;he s well capable&#8221; and had proven himself in previous roles. He said they believe Molefe has an &#8220;enormous role to play&#8221; in the country, &#8220;But we re taking this decision in the interest of good governance.&#8221;He said there are no plans as to where Molefe will go.Gigaba&#8217;s message to Eskom debt holders is that they want them to continue having faith that the shareholder will intervene to self-correct and ensure good governance applies and mistakes are corrected.He believes State-owned companies (SOCs) can be run properly, particularly because they pay well and have good incentives. It behoves those on the boards that the decisions they take are in the best interests of the [SOCs] and government. The Eskom AGM is coming up, during which the audited financial statements for the year will be provided. Brown has instructed the Eskom board executives to give her two names of candidates who can act as Group CE to ensure continuity.&#8220;The minister [Brown] has indicated we will rotate the board. There have to be consequences,&#8221; said Gigaba, adding that while their decision may have been the wrong one &#8211; the IMC is not reflecting on the board members&#8217; individual capabilities.ANC divideMolefe&#8217;s reinstatement opened up an increasingly bitter divide within the ANC ahead of a conference in December when a successor to Zuma as party president will be chosen. Zuma can remain as head of state until elections in 2019.Zuma&#8217;s camp is expected to back his ex-wife and former African Union Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, while another ANC faction will support Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.&#8220;The u-turn on Molefe&#8217;s Eskom appointment demonstrates that Zuma is capable of listening to dissent from within the party,&#8221; said Augustine Booth-Clibborn, analyst at Africa Risk Consulting.&#8220;However, it may also inspire a greater push against him as his enemies within and outside the ANC sense the president&#8217;s hand can be forced.&#8221;Molefe resigned in November after a report by the Public Protector, a constitutionally mandated corruption watchdog, raised questions over Eskom coal deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Zuma and the Gupta family deny wrongdoing.The report also raised concerns about ties between Eskom, Molefe and the Gupta family, wealthy businessmen and friends of Zuma who government ministers have accused of wielding undue influence over government appointments and public tenders.Zuma&#8217;s opponents say Molefe&#8217;s return was an attempt to control the large tenders handled by Eskom and called for a full parliamentary investigation.&#8220;The announcement today shows that governance at Eskom has crumbled,&#8221; said Natasha Mazzone, the Democratic Alliance&#8217;s shadow public enterprises minister.&#8220;Only a full-scale parliamentary inquiry has the capacity to get to the bottom of the rot.&#8221;
