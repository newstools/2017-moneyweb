Consensus expectations are for employers to have added 190 000 positions in the month, with a rise in the jobless rate to 4.6%. Analysts will also look to average hourly earnings, which are expected to grow 2.7% from a year earlier, and at retail employment a sector that has had a difficult start to the year.Crude crumbleWest Texas Intermediate for June delivery dropped as much as $1.76 to $43.76 a barrel, before recovering some ground to trade at $45.63 by 5:19am.

It wasn&#8217;t just technical factors hastening the plunge: traders are losing faith in Opec-led efforts to counteract the shale-fed glut through supply cuts.
