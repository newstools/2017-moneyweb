Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) is expected to announce steps to block the appointment of Phumeza Nhantsi (39) as permanent Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of SAA.Outa s Ben Theron told Moneyweb the organisation is studying information, including an earlier affidavit by then suspended SAA group treasurer Cynthia Stimpel, implicating Nhantsi as having played a central role in the national carrier s cancelled deal with BnP Capital to restructure its R15 billion of debt.Theron says Outa earlier made a detailed submission to parliament about the matter and will consider various options, including going back to parliament or taking steps to have Nhantsi declared a delinquent director.SAA in July last year terminated BnP s appointment after it came to light that BnP had no valid Financial Services Board (FSB) license.SAA on Wednesday announced Nhantsi s permanent appointment. She has been acting in the position since November 2015, after the resignation of her predecessor Wolf Meyer.Read: Treasury DG confirms appointment of new CFO at SAASAA said the appointment followed &#8220;a rigorous recruitment and selection process before a recommendation was made to the shareholder (government) for concurrence&#8221;.According to SAA Nhantsi, a director of accounting firm SizweNtsalubaGobodo (SNG), was seconded to SAA after Meyer resigned. Ms Nhantsi, who is a chartered accountant, has extensive experience in the financial services and aviation arena, SAA said in a statement.Moneyweb reported in August that Stimpel &#8211; in an affidavit supporting an application to the Labour Court &#8211; implicated Nhantsi as having played a central role in the BnP Capital deal.In the affidavit Stimpel described in detail how a tender for transaction advisory services was extended to include the sourcing of R15 billion funding at a fee of R256 million.Stimpel said the procurement process was flawed, that SAA could have sourced the funding itself and it could have done so for a fraction of the cost. To add insult to injury, BnP is a small company with an annual turnover of only R5 million and no experience in sourcing such a large amount of funding and had its license to do so suspended by the FSB, Stimpel stated.She described a process that started in 2015. By December 2015, following a request to the market, the SAA board rejected a recommendation from its treasury to appoint Seacrest Investments to source the R15 billion funding.It also rejected a bid by Absa, Standard Chartered and Nedbank to provide R5 billion long-term funding because it wanted the full amount sourced. It approved the appointment of the Free State Development Corporation to source the R15 billion. Stimpel maintained this decision was also taken in contraventions of procurement provisions.Without Stimpel s knowledge at the time, Nhantsi motivated to the board in January that it appoint a transaction advisor to assist with the R15 billion debt restructuring, Stimpel stated.The Request For Proposals (RFP) was issued in early in March. When Stimpel received the submission from the Bid Adjudication Committee (BAC) in this regard later that month, she raised her concerns with Nhantsi, saying SAA could do the job itself and didn t need a middleman, she stated.Without involving her or her deputy, BnP was appointed as the Transaction Advisor in April, Stimpel stated. According to the affidavit the appointment required the company to advise on the efficiency of SAA s current loans and leases and not to source funding.Stimpel said she learnt in a meeting with Nhantsi, about a week later, that the agreement with the Free State Development Corporations was off the table and that Nhantsi would ask the Transaction Advisor (BnP) to source the R15 billion. The SAA board accordingly made a resolution to extend the scope of agreement with BnP.Stimpel stated that she only learnt of this development on May 6 and refused to sign a document in support of it, due to her concern about the legality of the process followed and the fact that the fee was exorbitant.She in fact got hypothetical quotes from other banks. The highest quote was R85 million, while BnP stood to be paid R256 million for the same job.Stimpel said she advised Nhantsi to issue a new RFP, but Nhantsi did not respond to her emails and refused to meet with her.According to the affidavit she disclosed the state of affairs to National Treasury on May 11. A senior colleague warned her against raising the issue internally in SAA, saying she might be suspended as was SAA head of Commercial Sylvain Bosc earlier.Suspended SAA head of Human Resources Thuli Mpshe, advised her to make disclosures to National Treasury, the Public Protector and Outa, which she claimed she did.SAA had to make debt repayments of R7.3 billion by the end of June, which increased the urgency of the matter. She says she realised she could not just wait for a response from the authorities and met with Outa chairperson Wayne Duvenage.Stimpel denied ever disclosing information to the media about the matter.She said Outa filed a court application to stop the BnP contract. Facing the action SAA did not defend the lawfulness of the agreement, but instead announced that it would cancel it.Stimpel argued that her conduct met the requirement of the Protected Disclosures Act.In its statement announcing the cancellation of the BnP deal, SAA said it was still doing its due diligence when it received the legal correspondence from Outa and immediately acted upon it. It further stated that Stimpel s suspension had nothing to do with her opposition to the BnP deal. SAA at the time also denied that Stimpel s disclosures to Outa qualified as a protective disclosure.
