South African banking stocks remain on the back foot one month after the latest cabinet reshuffle but they appear to be faring better when compared with one month after the shock removal of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, dubbed Nenegate, in December 2015.The cabinet reshuffle, in which market-friendly finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were dismissed, weighed on domestic markets with banking stocks bearing the brunt of the pain. It also led to sovereign credit rating downgrades to sub-investment grade by Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s and Fitch. The ratings agencies also downgraded the major banks, in line with the sovereign. Unlike Nenegate, the cabinet reshuffle came as no surprise. Speculation that Gordhan and Jonas would be fired was rife following reports that they were recalled from an investment roadshow on March 27, 2017. Gordhan and Jonas were formally dismissed by President Jacob Zuma close to midnight on March 30, 2017. Shares in all the listed banking stocks closed more than 4.5% lower on March 31, 2017 &#8211; just hours after the cabinet reshuffle. Nedbank, Barclays Africa and Standard Bank were among the big losers on the day as their share prices fell by 7.35%, 7.16% and 6.47% respectively.Barring Investec, none of the listed banking stocks have recouped all of their losses one month after the cabinet reshuffle.Nenegate vs cabinet reshuffle: SA bank stocks performance one month later &nbsp;NenegateCabinet ReshuffleShare Price (R)% ChangeShare Price (R)% Change****9/12/15*11/01/1624/03/17**31/03/17***02/05/17Barclays Africa154.19126.5-17.96%158.50139.51147.99-6.63%Capitec572490-14.34%804.25761.37775.50-3.57%FirstRand45.5538-16.58%52.4546.3650.39-3.93%Investec PLC113.50103.36-8.93%93.4091.6098.60+5.57%Nedbank200.52169.50-15.47%262.86241.50225.51-14.21%Standard Bank122.37100-18.28%159143.75150.30-5.47%* closing price prior to Nene&#8217;s removal**closing price prior to reports of Gordhan&#8217;s recall***closing price after cabinet reshuffle****% change from 24/03/17 to 02/05/17Gary Booysen, portfolio manager at Rand Swiss, explained that Investec is most likely outperforming its local banking peers due to its geographic diversification.&#8220;The market would assume the stock s offshore exposure should insulate it from subdued local GDP growth rates and higher domestic borrowing costs. Only around 58% of Investec s revenue is generated locally, but just over 30% comes from the UK, while 10% comes from Australia. The UK has also delivered a string of positive economic data prints which would increase optimism over the banks&#8217; prospects in that territory,&#8221; he said.Still, the banking stocks are relatively stronger one month after the cabinet reshuffle than one month after Nenegate. According to Adrian Cloete, portfolio manager at PSG Wealth, the stocks have benefited from positive emerging market sentiment, which has underpinned the rand and the ten-year bond yield. As there is a very strong correlation between banking shares and the SA ten-year long bond yield, the downward move in the yield has therefore provided an underpin to banking shares . Conversely in December 2015, sentiment towards emerging markets was less supportive, hence the market reaction was greater as there was no positive underlying support for emerging markets then, he said.Renier de Bruyn, investment analyst at Sanlam Private Wealth, said the relative outperformance after the cabinet reshuffle would be even better if the dividends declared by most of the big banks were taken into account. A number of large banking shares traded ex-dividend in the month after the cabinet reshuffle. Commodity prices were under extreme pressure during the post Nenegate month, as well as the impact from the drought, which created concerns over default risk from the banks exposures to mining and agriculture clients. These were not concerns during the month following cabinet reshuffle, he added.However, Nedbank s recovery appears to be hampered by the performance of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI). Nedbank took a R1 billion impairment against the Pan-African lender, in which it holds a 21.2%, during the 2016 financial year as the carrying value of its investment decreased from R7.8 billion to R4 billion.Domestic banks also face a number of challenges including slow earnings and revenue growth, which may come to bear if South Africa s GDP growth slows, as loan growth slows and continued pressure on banking fees. Added to this is the higher expected funding cost that banks may face when refinancing debt as a result of their credit rating downgrades, said de Bruyn.Cloete said changing sentiment toward emerging markets could also lead to reversals of inflows in emerging markets. Should this occur, the ten-year bond yield is likely to tick up again and exert pressure on interest-sensitive banking shares. In spite of the current conditions, domestic banks are in a relatively strong position. SA banks are also much better positioned than pre the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/9 as common equity tier 1 capital ratios are 40% higher now, banks have been cautious on advances growth, have increased bad debt provision coverage, defaulted advances are much lower, are much more liquid, have much stronger funding profiles and their earnings are well diversified, he said.
