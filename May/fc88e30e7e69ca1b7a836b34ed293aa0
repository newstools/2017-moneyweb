LONDON &#8211; Concern over Italy&#8217;s banks and Britain&#8217;s national election dominated holiday-thinned European financial markets on Monday, pushing stock markets lower after Asian share indices fell back off two-year highs.Sterling, hammered by a slump for Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s Conservatives in opinion polls last week, recovered after weekend polls confirmed the trend but showed her still on course to win next week&#8217;s vote.European share prices were lower overall, but Italian banks and blue chips fell as worries over recapitalisations of regional Italian lenders bled over into a second week .Weekend reports that Italy&#8217;s main parties could converge on a proportional electoral law pointed to growing chances of an early election that may yield an indecisive hung parliament.&#8220;The risk of early elections has suddenly increased to 60%,&#8221; LC Macro Advisers founder Lorenzo Codogno said. &#8220;A hung parliament is thus the most likely outcome.&#8221;European blue chips overall slipped 0.2%, but losses for Banco BPM, Unicredit and others drove a 3.4% loss for Italy&#8217;s banking index &#8211; its biggest in nearly four months.Milan&#8217;s main blue-chip index fell almost 2% while Germany&#8217;s DAX was little changed.Asian markets were also lower overall after some early gains that largely shrugged off another missile launch by North Korea , the broad MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipping 0.2%.Japan&#8217;s Nikkei edged up 0.2% while Australian shares fell as much as 0.8%, hit by another round of falls in the prices of oil and other commodities. China&#8217;s markets are also closed on Monday and Tuesday for a holiday.On currency markets, the dollar was flat, trading at $1.1185 per euro and 111.35 yen after steadying on a better batch of US economic data on Friday that solidified expectations of a rise in official interest rates next month.San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said in Singapore on Monday that medium-term trends in US inflation remained &#8220;pretty favourable,&#8221; despite some recent soft consumer price data.After falling more than 2 cents last week, sterling was 0.2 to 0.3% stronger against the dollar and euro .&#8220;A lot of what we are seeing is the after effects of Friday&#8217;s news and data releases,&#8221; said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt.&#8220;We have a little bit of dollar strength following better U.\S data and some hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials. And we have a little bit of a pound recovery following the latest poll results from the UK.&#8221;
