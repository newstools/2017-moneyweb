South African cement producer PPC’s board on Wednesday turned its back on a takeover attempt by AfriSam, backed by Canadian firm Fairfax Africa Investments. PPC has been a takeover target on-and-off for several years, with local-based AfriSam, Nigeria’s Dangote Cement Irish building materials firm CRH and Switzerland’s LafargeHolcim all interested in it. But in a move anticipated by analysts, PPC’s independent board said it had advised Fairfax that it will not be recommending the Canadian company’s partial offer to shareholders and that it will not convene a general meeting to approve the proposed merger by AfriSam.

Fairfax offered to buy 22% of PPC in September for R5.75 per share, or R2 billion ($144 million), on condition that it was approved by shareholders in order to allow AfriSam’s merger plan. PPC, which has operations in six countries across Africa, said the board took into account the cement producer’s own valuation work, forecasts and recent financial and business performance as well as feedback from shareholders. Shares in PPC, which has a market capitalisation of R10.29 billion and had net debt of R4.7 billion at the end of March, were up 2.47% to R6.63 by 1248 GMT.     It said it will continue its engagements with CRH and LafargeHolcim.
