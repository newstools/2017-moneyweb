South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers (Num) plans a coal sector strike after wage negotiations with mining firms became deadlocked, it said on Wednesday, without giving a date for industrial action. Num spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said the union had been granted a strike certificate by a government mediator, which is an important requirement before downing tools. A protracted strike in the coal sector could affect power supply in Africa’s most industrialised economy, as about 85% of it is generated from the fossil fuel.
