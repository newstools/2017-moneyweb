Announcements by leaders of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress about groups of candidates to be elected as officials at the party’s conference next month are unacceptable and must stop, secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said. Such announcements “seek to usurp the entrenched right of the branches to nominate candidates of their choosing,” Mantashe said in an emailed statement on Monday. “The 2015 National General Council resolved to outlaw slates and reaffirm the role of the branch as the basic unit of the ANC.”  The Star newspaper reported earlier Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa wants Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor as his deputy should he be chosen as ANC leader, with Senzo Mchunu, a former premier of the KwaZulu-Natal province, as the secretary-general of the party.
