General Khehla Sitole has been appointed as national police commissioner, the presidency said on Wednesday, following nearly three years of the post being filled on acting basis. South Africa has been without a permanent head of police since President Jacob Zuma suspended Riah Phiyega in 2015 pending an investigation into her role in the 2012 killing of 34 miners by officers during a violent wildcat strike over pay in Marikana on the platinum belt.
