South Africa will implement spending cuts of R25 billion ($1.8 billion) and raise revenue by R15 billion in next year’s budget to contain growing debt, finance minister Malusi Gigaba told parliament on Wednesday. Gigaba said the extra R40 billion, or 0.8% of GDP, would be used to tackle rising public debt which otherwise could balloon beyond 60% of GDP by 2022. ($1 = R13.89)
