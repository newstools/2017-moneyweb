Investors are learning that the backing of Tencent Holdings isn’t a guarantee of IPO riches.  Stock buyers piled into the initial public offering of the Chinese technology titan’s e-book arm China Literature, hoping it would repeat Tencent’s 500-fold increase since its own listing. While they’ve been quickly rewarded since China Literature’s debut last week, with shares rising 83% through mid-day on Thursday, some other Tencent-backed companies that recently went public in the US are far from thriving.  Shares of Sogou, China’s No. 3 search engine, closed below their offer price on Wednesday after three straight days of declines. The company, whose biggest shareholder is Tencent, is now down 2.4% since its debut in New York last week. Sea, a Tencent-backed online gaming portal, has fallen 1.9% in US trading since its October listing. The latest Tencent investment to hit the market is online car-financing provider Yixin Group, which rose as 30% on its Hong Kong debut Thursday before paring its gains.      There’s more coming. Tencent’s Spotify-like music platform has asked for banks to pitch for a role in an IPO next year that could raise as much at least $1 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier. © 2017 Bloomberg
