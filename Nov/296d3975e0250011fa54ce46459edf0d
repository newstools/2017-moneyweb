South Africa’s Treasury said on Wednesday Ian Stuart has been appointed acting deputy director-general for the budget office following the resignation Michael Sachs. The rand and government bonds tumbled earlier this month after local media outlet Fin24 reported that Sachs resigned over alleged interference by President Jacob Zuma in the budget process. Treasury said Sachs was leaving the department to join the civil service in a different capacity. Stuart is currently the chief director for fiscal policy in the budget office, a position he has held since August 2015, Treasury said.
