South Africa’s rand firmed on Thursday, helped by favourable sentiment for emerging market currencies and upbeat retail sales data a day earlier, while stocks ended higher lead by pulp and paper producer Sappi . At 1511 GMT, the rand traded at 14.23 to the US dollar, 1.15% firmer than its close on Wednesday. The rand is up around 1% against the dollar since last Friday, after a torrid few weeks in which it has been battered by the increasing likelihood that South Africa’s credit ratings will be downgraded further this month. S&P Global and Moody’s are scheduled to review South Africa’s ratings on November 24, and a one-notch downgrade of the local-currency rating by both agencies could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of the country’s bonds. Halen Bothma at ETM Analytics said the rand was getting a temporary reprieve on Thursday partly due to retail sales data on Wednesday, which had painted a more robust picture of the economy than expected. “After a selloff in the rand, the market sometimes turns. But I wouldn’t say it’s a major fundamental move,” Bothma added. Emerging-market currencies including the Russian rouble were also rallying elsewhere on global markets. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 closed 5 basis points lower at 9.36%, reflecting stronger bond prices. On the bourse, stocks ended higher as Sappi rose 4% after the company reported higher full-year profit. The Top-40 index closed up 0.7% at 53,378.66, while the broader all-share ended 0.6% higher at 59,549.22.
