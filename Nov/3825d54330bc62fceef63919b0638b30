Africa’s biggest company by market value, Naspers, reported a 65% jump in first-half profit on Wednesday, boosted by internet businesses that include the largest stake in China’s Tencent Holdings . Cape Town-based Naspers, which owns about a third of the Chinese internet company, said headline earnings rose to $1.5 billion, or 350 cents per share, from $914 million, or 212 cents per share. Headline earnings per share (EPS) is Naspers’ main profit measure that strips out non-operational and one-off items. Its internet division contributed 77% of Naspers’ revenue, up from 72% a year earlier. “Robust growth saw internet revenues increasing 42% year on year to $6.9 billion,” the company said. “Boosted by classifieds and another exceptional performance by Tencent, trading profit for the internet segment was $1.8 billion up 47% year on year,” it said. The share price of Naspers, which also has stakes in Germany’s Delivery Hero, Russia’s Mail.ru and India’s Flipkart, has doubled this year buoyed by Tencent’s sharp climb. Naspers shares were up 0.3% at R3 790 at 1324 GMT versus a 0.5% rise in the JSE’s benchmark Top 40 index.
