South Africa recorded an unexpected trade surplus in October, as exports of mineral and chemical products as well as base metals climbed due to a weaker currency and subdued demand for imports locally. The rand has been volatile over the past month, slumping to its weakest level in 12 months against the dollar in late October following a gloomy budget speech that revealed a gaping revenue gap and public debt soaring to 60% of GDP. The currency has however recovered those losses in the past week on renewed hopes of economic reform despite a decision last Friday by S&P Global Ratings to push the country’s debt deeper into “junk”. Analysts said the weak rand and improved global demand for commodities were the main reasons for the surplus. The trade surplus widened slightly to R4.56 billion  ($335 million) from a revised R4.48 billion  surplus, data from the Revenue Service (Sars) showed. A Reuters poll had forecast a 1 billion deficit. Exports of chemical products jumped 20% in the month, while those of base metal and mineral products rose 13% and 12%, respectively. So far this year, the trade balance is at a R51.6 billion  surplus compared to a R9.9 billion  shortfall over the same period in 2016. “If we didn’t see the dramatic moves on the rand over that period we absolutely would have recorded a deficit this month, so it has helped,” said head of trade statistics at Sars Victor Munyama Munyama said an expected spike in imports heading into the Christmas period had not materialised due to weak consumer demand. Consumer and business confidence remain around record lows with the country mired in high-level corruption scandals and political turmoil. ($1 = R13.59)
