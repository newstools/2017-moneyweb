The average time on the market for luxury homes has spiked to the highest in at least the last decade, with houses in this ‘high-net-worth’ segment now spending 23.29 weeks ‘for sale’. This is a sharp increase over the past year, and a nearly 50% jump from the 15.86 weeks on average from 2014. According to FNB’s estate agent survey, the average house price in this segment is just over R7 million. That means suburbs like Bryanston, Dainfern, Waterfall, Waterkloof, areas just north of Durban, parts of the Atlantic Seaboard, Cape Town’s Southern Suburbs, and so on… While ‘upper-end’ homes “tend to ‘naturally’ stay on the market for a longer time on average prior to sales than is the case at the lower-priced end”, there has been a noticeable divergence in the market says a report from FNB. “From 2015 onward, we began to notice a widening in the gap in average time of homes on the market between the luxury (high-net-worth) and upper-income area segments on the one hand, and the middle- and lower-income area segments on the other hand.” (It notes that the income areas in this survey are self-defined by agents.) Aside from homes in these high-net-worth areas, FNB says there has been a “significant” increase in the average time on the market in the ‘upper-income area’ segment, with an average price of about R3.5 million, from 13.36 weeks in 2014 to 16.38 weeks in the first three quarters of 2017. Source: FNB’s estate agent survey “In 2014, the ‘lower-income’ area segment (average value = R1.26 million) showed an average time of homes on the market of 11.54 weeks. This average time has shortened to an 8.81-week average for the first three quarters of 2017. Middle-income areas (average price = R1.6 million) saw average time on market go slightly higher from 10.18 weeks on average in 2014 to 11.43 weeks in the first three quarters of 2017. Linked to this is the fact that there has been a sharp deceleration in house price inflation in the luxury segment since the first quarter of last year, according to two different reports on the residential market. Lightstone Property’s house price index data for October shows that prices at the upper-end of the market dropped by 0.1% year-on-year, on average, in September. Price growth has been running at below 2% for the last six months and the year-to-date average for nine months is 1.6%. This is a far cry from the 7.4%, 6.1% and 4.2% seen in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. FNB’s area value band house price index shows a similar trend, not at all surprising as both use deeds office data. Whereas Lightstone segments the market into four segments, FNB’s luxury area quintile is the “group of areas with the highest transaction price averages in South Africa, making up 20% of the total volume of property transactions by individuals”. In this segment, the average house price is R2.271 million. Year-on-year price growth slowed from 6.1% in the second quarter of this year to 5.3% in the third quarter. With CPI at around the 5% mark, this means real year-on-year price growth is just marginally positive. “The most significant year-on-year house price growth slowing in recent years has been in the luxury area value band, from an 11.1% high back in the final quarter of 2014 to the most recent 5.3%, followed by the upper income value band [average price of R1.231 million] whose growth has slowed from 7.5% at the end of 2014 to 4.9%,” writes John Loos, household and property sector strategist at FNB. Source: FNB’s estate agent survey “The high-end of the market appears to have led the slowdown of recent years.” Loos says the “house price growth differential between the three highest-priced FNB area value band house price indices has nearly completely converged, with all three of these segments having shown recent growth slowing. Compare this to the lower-, middle- and even high-value segments of the market and it is easy to see just how under pressure the upper-end is. In fact, in the lower two quartiles using Lightstone’s methodology (and lower two quintiles in FNB’s), price inflation has been accelerating this year.

The result is, on average, a more financially cautious household searching for greater home affordability, which should mean some shift in demand towards the more affordable areas of the market”.
