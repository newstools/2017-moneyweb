Investors in multi-asset high-equity (or balanced) funds should, and generally are, putting their money away for the long term. Their investment horizons are anything from five to 40 years, or even more. Yet there is still an obsession with how funds perform from year to year. Just looking at the flows into unit trusts shows quite clearly that there are many investors basing their fund choices on 12-month returns. An analysis of the year-to-year performance of top-performing funds over the last ten years however shows how problematic this is. The table below shows the ten funds that were top performers in the South African multi-asset high-equity category in each of the ten one-year periods starting from October 1 2007 and ending September 30 2017. Some might argue that this is an arbitrary time frame, but it’s really no more so than a calendar year. Markets don’t move according to the calendar. The table illustrates the performance of these funds over each of these ten periods. The numbers in the boxes show their category ranking, and the colours depict in which quintile they fell. The lightest green is top quintile performance, and each shade darker is one quintile lower. 10-year performance of SA multi-asset high-equity funds 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Total number of funds 35 41 44 48 55 63 79 81 94 116 Dotport BCI Pudential FoF 1 3 35 20 32 39 62 55 68 69 Cadiz Balanced Fund 30 1 9 41 7 46 79 76 37 2 Coronation Balanced Plus Fund 8 11 1 15 25 3 19 51 32 35 Investec Opportunity Fund 2 20 23 1 24 48 57 15 18 64 Rezco Value Trend Fund 3 21 36 5 1 4 50 4 91 59 Momentum Best Blend Balanced FoF 23 30 33 34 12 1 17 30 21 47 Nedgroup Investments Balanced Fund – – – – – 27 1 3 60 106 Autus BCI Balanced Fund 20 13 26 40 15 7 30 1 86 101 Allan Gray Balanced Fund 6 6 31 2 44 21 7 70 1 65 Investec Managed Fund 15 36 13 7 18 39 53 5 8 1 Source: Morningstar The first observation is that no fund is consistently a top performer. There isn’t one that doesn’t appear in the fourth quintile at least once over this period, and there are only four that weren’t ever in the bottom quintile. Investors need to expect this. Any fund, no matter how good, will go through times of underperformance. On top of this, performance is highly variable from one year to the next. Nothing demonstrates this more starkly than the Autus BCI Balanced Fund, which went from being the top fund in 2015 to featuring in the bottom quintile in both of the following two years. There is, in fact, only one fund that managed to not drop out to at least the third quintile within three years of being the top performer. That is the Momentum Best Blend Balanced Fund of Funds, which performed very consistently between 2012 and 2016. This demonstrates how difficult it is to maintain outperformance over the short term. It’s also worth noting that even the good run enjoyed by the Momentum fund followed four years in which it was consistently in the fourth quintile. Its history over the period from 2008 to 2011 would have given no indication that it would be one of the best funds in this category over the following five years. There are also two funds – the Cadiz Balanced Fund and Allan Gray Balanced Fund – that went from being in the bottom quartile one year to being the top fund the next. In both cases, these funds also slipped back into at least the fourth quintile within the next two years. Finally, it’s worth making the observation that it’s impossible from looking at the above table to know which of these funds have been the top performers over this entire period. The Momentum Best Blend Balanced Fund of Funds may look the most consistent, but it is only the 13th best-performing fund in this category out of the 35 funds that have decade-long records.

It delivered an annualised return of only 7.99%. All of these factors together make it quite obvious that there is little, if anything, to be gained by looking at a fund’s one-year performance. It tells an investor next to nothing about its longer-term prospects. Portfolio manager at PSG Wealth, Schalk Louw, says that choosing funds purely on their last one year’s performance is simply not a sound way of managing your risk and investments. You have to consider other factors as well: “Always consider the following criteria when choosing funds: the underlying costs attached to funds, the quality and history of the management team, the fund manager’s abilities to deliver constant (not limited to a one-year period) above-average risk-adjusted returns, as well as the size (in rand value) of the underlying funds. These four factors, in my opinion, are far more important investment aids than to limit your choices to past-performing funds,” Louw says.
