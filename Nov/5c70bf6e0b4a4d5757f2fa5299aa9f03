Netcare, South Africa’s largest private hospital group, took a dive on the JSE after news that its earnings per share will be at least 130% lower compared to the previous financial year. On Wednesday morning, the share price opened at R25.25, but quickly dropped to R23.76 per share. After picking up slightly, it was beaten down again to R23.11 per share in the early afternoon. It has lost more than 20% in value when compared to a year ago. Netcare announced that the financial year results to September will include the allocation of a non-cash accounting adjustment of R5.563 billion (£316.3 million) to the impairment of property, plant and equipment, onerous lease provisions and the impairment of goodwill. Accordingly, its earnings will be between 130% and 135% lower (R2 158 million and R2 241 million) and earnings per share between 130% and 135% lower (159.4 cents and 165.5 cents) than those for the previous financial year of R1 660 million and 122.6 cents, respectively. Netcare says trading conditions were challenging in the United Kingdom (UK), particularly in the second half of the financial year. In April lower tariffs for National Health Services (“NHS”) work became effective, while patient activity were affected by demand management initiatives implemented by both the NHS and private medical insurers. Wayne McCurrie, senior portfolio analyst of Ashburton Investments, called it a “catastrophe”, saying Netcare suffered in the UK as a result of pressure from the NHS and private health insurers to lower costs. This is a global trend affecting health care providers, but the extent of Netcare’s suffering surprised the share market. The full year 2017 results also include a large non-cash fair value accounting profit of R937 million (£57.2 million) arising from the mark-to-market valuation of Netcare’s BMI Healthcare’s Retail Price Index (“RPI”) swap instruments related to existing long-term leases. The group excluded impairments from the headline earnings per share (HEPS), which only include the onerous lease provision and mark-to-market valuation of the RPI swap instruments. Heps are expected to be between 5.0% and 10.0% lower (5.9 cents and 11.9 cents) than the 119.0 cents of the previous financial year.  Netcare’s results for the year will be released on November 20.
