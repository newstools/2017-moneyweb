The rand fell on Wednesday as investors took profits on a rally sparked by the country avoiding a double downgrade on its local currency debt and bets of a business-friendly outcome to the ruling party’s leadership battle. At 1508 GMT the rand had slipped 0.46% to 13.72 per dollar, moving away from a six-week high of 13.56 touched in the previous session. The rand had rallied in two previous sessions on relief that ratings agency Moody’s would wait until after the African National Congress (ANC) leadership conference and February’s budget, before downgrading the country’s debt. S&P Global Ratings downgraded Pretoria’s local currency debt to sub-investment grade on Friday and thrust the foreign currency debt deeper into “junk” territory, while Moody’s opted to put the rating on review for a downgrade. The rand had also benefited from increasing signs that Cyril Ramaphosa was leading Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in the race to replace President Jacob Zuma as leader of the ANC.

Higher risk EM currencies are all on the back foot.” Government bonds also weakened, with the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 adding 11 basis points to 9.29%. On the bourse, the main stock indices ended higher, tracking an upbeat tone in major overseas markets, though Lonmin was out of favour after a brokerage house cut its target price on the troubled mining company.
