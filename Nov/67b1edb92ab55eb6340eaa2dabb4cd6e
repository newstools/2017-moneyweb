Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan has been appointed as a visiting professor in the Wits School of Governance. Gordhan, who was removed as finance minster in a cabinet reshuffle on March 31 by President Jacob Zuma, will start his new post on December 1.  The former finance minister has been vocal on issues of state capture and corporate governance, especially at state-owned enterprises.  “Gordhan’s strong views on corruption and financial mismanagement are well known – these are the values that we want to impress upon our students, many of whom serve in the public sector,” says professor David Everatt, head of the Wits School of Governance.  Everatt believes that Gordhan’s strong experience, sound public financial management and principled stand on good governance and transformation of the economy will add substantial value to the academic programme. Gordhan joins the likes of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, who is interim director of the Wits Business School, former parliamentary speaker Max Sisulu, who is research fellow at the Wits School of Governance and former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni, who joined the Wits School of Economic and Business Sciences as an honorary professor in 2015.  “Pravin Gordhan has a very successful track record in management of the public service. The skill sets that he has acquired through his years of managerial experience will be the basis of rich learning for the university and its students,” says Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib.
