There is a general sentiment among the investing public that trends persist and stay intact longer than what most people anticipate. Although I would not necessarily disagree with this phenomenon, I certainly wouldn’t apply this as a rule to all spheres of life and in particular, investments. The ability of active investment managers in South Africa to beat the market on a consistent basis has been entertained on more than one occasion. Some professionals even claim they can pick who the next outperforming manager will be over a certain investment horizon. However, historical data is actually available and we can research the fact with more precision. Before we jump into the details please take into account that we are using three-year funds data for the general equity sector of South Africa. In follow up studies I will alter the time periods in order to prove that the conclusions are no different… wherever you go across the globe. The study and how managers perform over time For the three years to September 30 2015 there were 31 funds out of 108 that outperformed the JSE All Share Index on a total return basis. The index return was 15.38% per annum (black line in graph below) meaning only 28.7% of funds performed better – the green columns in the graph below.   Source: Morningstar, three-year performance from September 30 2012 to September 30 2015 Two years later the performance of the market shifted lower to a total return of 7.18% for the three years to September 30 2017. A total of 133 funds competed with only 17 of them claiming a position higher than the index return (a success rate of a mere 12.78%). Source: Morningstar, three-year performance from September 30 2014 to September 30 2017 It’s obvious that the probability of picking an outperforming fund is fairly low. By making use of an index fund returning the market performance you did not only beat the majority of active managers, you also prevented yourself from underperforming severely. The best-performing fund for the three years ending September 30 2017 was 4.39% above the market return. However, the worst-performing fund was 10.05% below the market return illustrating the extent of underperformance is far greater than the outperformance. It is clear that there is a “safer” one directional winning bet – getting performance in line with the market. Getting back to the point of trends… can we make the assumption that managers that performed well in the past can sustain that performance? How many of the 31 managers that outperformed for the three years to September 30 2015 are still outperforming for the three years ending September 30 2017? A simple exercise revealed that only eight managers still found themselves on the right hand side of the JSE All Share total return.   
Source: Morningstar, three-year performance from September 30 2014 to September 30 2017 We can make several conclusions regarding active manager performance over this period: September 30 2017 is only two years after September 30 2015 which means we have another 12 months to go before we are in a new 36-month period – the percentage of managers that consistently outperform the market will continue to shrink!
