The Department of Public Enterprises has confirmed that the process to appoint a new Eskom board is “on track”. Finance minister Malusi Gigaba highlighted the risks posed by Eskom to the economy in his maiden Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. Gigaba undertook to appoint – in conjunction with the Minister of Public Enterprises whose responsibility Eskom falls under – a new board by the end of November. “The process is on track,” said Public Enterprises spokesman Colin Cruywagen on Thursday. The process has been delayed by the postponement of the Cabinet meeting at which the names of the new directors will be presented. Cabinet is set to meet next week.
