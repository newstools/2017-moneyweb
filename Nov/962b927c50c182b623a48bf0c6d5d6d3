The rand inched firmer on Wednesday, holding its ground against the weaker dollar with higher gold prices and signs of improving economic growth luring back buyers. Stocks were down as resource companies suffered as part of a global selloff. At 1440 GMT the rand was 0.1% firmer at 14.36 per dollar, marginally firmer that its close of 14.37 overnight in New York. The rand climbed to a session best of 14.3100, with bids spread almost evenly between 14.34 and 14.40, the former a recent technical resistance target that could open the door for further gains towards 14.20. Traders said buying action would be concentrated at these levels as investors looked to find positions ahead of next Thursday’s local lending rates decision and credit rating announcements the day after. All but two of the 28 economists surveyed over the past week by Reuters said rates would stay at 6.75% at the November 23 Reserve Bank meeting.

Retail sales rose by 5.4% year-on-year in September, beating expectation of 4.5% expansion, according to Statistics South Africa. “Despite the month-on-month falls in output and spending in September, it looks like the economy enjoyed reasonably strong growth over Q3 as a whole,” said senior emerging markets analyst at Capital Economics William Jackson. Stocks ended weaker, with the Top 40 Index 53 004 points and the wider All Share measure falling 0.56% to 59 185 points. Gains on the gold index tracking higher global bullion prices were countered by losses in resources, banking and general retailers.
