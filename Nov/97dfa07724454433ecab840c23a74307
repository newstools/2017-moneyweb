South Africa’s rand was little changed early on Thursday, after a weaker dollar gave it a boost in the previous session. At 0653 GMT, the rand traded at 14.16 versus the dollar, 0.04% weaker than its New York close on Wednesday. The dollar has weakened amid concern that Republican plans for major US tax cuts will be delayed. That helped emerging-market currencies bounce on Wednesday. Stocks were set to open up at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 futures index up 0.11%. Government bonds were also barely changed, with the yield on the benchmark instrument due in 2026 down 1 basis point to 9.26%. South Africa is set to release monthly mining production data later on Thursday.
