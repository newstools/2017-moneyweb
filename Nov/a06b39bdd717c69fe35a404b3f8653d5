Each year the International Monetary Fund projects gross domestic product per capita — a rough measure of living standards — for almost every country in the world. The annual shifts aren’t big, although notice that China has gradually improved from poor to lower-middle-income. The country outlooks below are based on reports by Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Economics.    Canada GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $47 658 Canadians haven’t given up on a new North American Free Trade Agreement with the US, but they’re also pursuing a trade deal with China. Mexico GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $10 021 Leftist nationalist Andrés Manuel López Obrador is leading in the polls and could be elected to a six-year term as president in July. US GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $61 687 The Trump administration is likely to keep the world guessing on issues including trade, fiscal stimulus, and military alliances. Brazil GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $10 515 The economy climbed out of recession this year, but the political scandals that threaten to envelop President Michel Temer jeopardise growth. Italy GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $33 725 Divisions on the right are increasing the chance that a populist, eurosceptic government could take power after general elections, which are set for May or earlier.  UK GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $40 026 Britain’s exit from the European Union must happen by March 2019. The battle over terms of disengagement will get even more fractious in 2018. Germany GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $47 535 Germany continues to export way more than it imports, annoying its neighbours. In 2018 its current account surplus seems likely to remain above the 6% ceiling prescribed by the EU. Nigeria GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $2 376 Oil output is rebounding after touching a 27-year low in 2016, when militants attacked pipelines. An overvalued currency could deter foreign investment. Saudi Arabia GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $21 453 The government is scheduled to sell shares in Saudi Aramco, the oil giant, but there are reports it may delay the international portion of the sale until at least 2019. Russia GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $10 630 Domestic oil producers appear to be abiding by an agreement with Opec to cut production. The biggest risk for the economy in 2018 is a sharp fall in oil prices. India GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $1 989 Growth slowed earlier this year. But with inflation finally under control, the Reserve Bank of India is likely to cut interest rates, fueling a rebound. Australia GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $58 941 The government will continue to fight a debt-fueled bubble in home prices in 2018. Almost 40% of such loans are interest-only, and 85% have variable rates. South Korea GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $30 919 Improving global demand has fueled a comeback in exports. Despite the threat of attack from North Korea, businesses keep investing, and consumers keep spending.  Japan GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $40 063 Fresh off re-election in October, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will redouble efforts to restructure the economy — the third arrow in his quiver after fiscal and monetary policy. China GDP per capita, 2018 forecast: $9 377 Having been elected to a second five-year term in October, President Xi Jinping may use 2018 to push essential but unpopular measures, such as closing inefficient plants. © 2017 Bloomberg
