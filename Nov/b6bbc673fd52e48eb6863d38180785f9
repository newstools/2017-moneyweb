The CEO of the Pam Golding Properties Group, Andrew Golding, was a doctor for seven years before he joined the family business. This, he believes, equipped him with the most important skill demanded by the culture of his company – which  is the ability to listen. Unlike strategic, management or negotiation skills, this ability to listen feeds directly into the group’s philosophy of connecting with buyers and sellers on an authentic, sincere and empathetic level first, before attempting to conclude any transaction. In fact Golding insists that the first characteristic that any aspirant Pam Golding employee has to possess is not that of a being super salesperson, but rather they need to demonstrate a like-mindedness with the company practice of human connection. It’s clearly a principle that works well, in an industry where trust is profoundly important, but Golding maintains that listening is fundamental to all businesses. In this Quick Insight video, extracted from a full-length face-to-face interview with him, Golding expands on the art of listening in his organisation. View the full length interview here.
