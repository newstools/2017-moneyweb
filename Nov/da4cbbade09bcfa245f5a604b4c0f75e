The rand currency was firmer on Wednesday, boosted by positive economic data and a return of investors attracted by the low exchange rate and high bond yields ahead of an interest rate decision by the US central bank. Stocks rallied to new highs, tracking global markets and buoyed by mining shares. At 1510 GMT the rand had gained 0.3% to 14.07 per dollar, up from a close of 14.11 overnight in New York. The rand climbed to a session best of 14.04 before paring gains slightly but remained in demand as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve would keep lending rates unchanged at its meeting later in the session. Locally, new vehicle sales figures for October brought some good news after last Wednesday’s medium term budget revealed the country’s spending deficit and public debt were increasing at a faster pace than expected. Data from the government trade department showed new vehicle sales rose 4.6% year-on-year to 51 037 in October. “The rand is taking direction from a slightly risk-on environment as markets await the Fed’s policy statement. Things have also started to stabilise after the shock of last week’s budget,” said economist at ETM Analytics Halen Bothma. “With South African assets there seems to be a ceiling when things sell off very quickly. There’ll always be a pull-back and now investors are recognising value opportunity across bonds and on the FX side,” Bothma said. The yield on the benchmark bond due in 2026 was down 7.5 basis points at 9.035%, its firmest since last Wednesday’s budget speech. On the stock market, the Top 40 Index was up 0.9% at 53 056.59 points, while the broader All Share Index rose 0.9% to 59 514.11 points. Both indexes scaled new highs in intraday trading. Anglo American was the biggest gainer among the blue chips, rising 4% to R275.71, while BHP Billiton was up 3% at R263. Bullion producers were also in demand as the price of gold rose on uncertainty ahead of this week’s confirmation of the new Fed chair, with the gold mining index rising 2.2% to 1 407.50 points.
