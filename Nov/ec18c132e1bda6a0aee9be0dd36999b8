Microblogging website Twitter, known for its iconic 140-character tweets, said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world. Twitter said it ran a test on 280-character tweets in September that showed users spent less time editing their tweets and were less likely to abandon them.  Source: Twitter User posting in languages including Japanese, Korean and Chinese, which do not face the issue of “cramming”, will continue to have a limit of 140 characters, Twitter said. The company did not say when it would start allowing users to post 280-character tweets.
