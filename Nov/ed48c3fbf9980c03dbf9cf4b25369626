South Africa’s Vodacom Group posted a 1.1% rise in half-year earnings on Monday, while net profit increased 7%, boosted by the acquisition of Safaricom. Headline earnings per share – the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items – came in at 445 cents in the six-months ended September, compared with 440 cents a year earlier. Vodacom, a unit of UK-based Vodafone, declared an interim dividend per share of 390 cents, slightly changed from the previous year. Vodafone consolidated two of its African interests in May with the transfer of a 35% stake in Kenya’s Safaricom to majority-owned South African subsidiary Vodacom.
