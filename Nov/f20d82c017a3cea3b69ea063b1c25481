South Africa’s rand was slightly weaker early on Friday, retreating from a one-week high against the dollar ahead of important market-moving events next week. At 0719 GMT the rand had lost 0.21% to 14.19 per dollar, but it was up 1.4% on the week after rising from a 12-month low on Monday. The greenback slipped on Friday, weakened by a report that investigators into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election had subpoenaed President Donald Trump’s election campaign for documents. Investors in South African assets are nervous ahead of ratings reviews by S&P Global and Moody’s agencies on November 24. A one-notch downgrade of the local-currency rating by both agencies could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of the country’s bonds, as well as triggering a heavy selloff the rand. Stocks were trading slightly higher, with the JSE securities exchange’s All-share index up 0.3%. Yields on bonds were lower, with the benchmark ten-year paper due in 2026 down 3.5 basis points to 9.325%.
