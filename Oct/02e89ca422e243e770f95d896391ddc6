The cost of insuring exposure to South African debt rose on Wednesday to the highest since October 2 after the country’s budget deficit forecast was widened by the government to an eight-year high. Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for South Africa rose 6 basis points (bps) from Tuesday’s close to 182 bps, data from IHS Markit data showed. The 4.3% deficit forecast was wider than economists had expected. South Africa’s Treasury also halved its economic growth forecast for 2017 to 0.7% and said annual growth would remain below 2% for the next three years.
