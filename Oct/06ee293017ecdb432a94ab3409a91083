The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) delivered by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba last week has spooked South African investors and analysts. With growth expectations coming in below the global average and a weak currency eating into investment returns, many South Africans are now looking for ways to protect their hard-earned capital. Applications to move money offshore, spiked following the rapid weakening of the Rand last week. Structured products offering protection against market volatility are proving to be a popular hedge for SA investors who are concerned about growth rates in South Africa but having to weigh up whether global markets are expensive or not. These structured products offer guarantees of capital protection over a fixed-term, giving investors peace of mind that their investment goals will be met and they can enjoy hard-currency returns.
