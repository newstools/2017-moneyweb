Pilots of South Africa’s Mango, a low-cost airline owned by national carrier South African Airways, on Monday downed tools demanding an 8.5 percent salary increase, the union representing most of the pilots said. “We are demanding 8.5 percent and Mango has not moved from its initial offer of 6 percent,” said the Solidarity union’s deputy general secretary Deon Reyneke. Solidarity has 100 of Mango’s 110 pilots as its members.
