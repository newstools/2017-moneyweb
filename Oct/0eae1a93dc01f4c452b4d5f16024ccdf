The rand dropped to a 10-month low on Wednesday after finance minister Malusi Gigaba flagged weaker growth expectations and rising government debt in his budget speech. Stocks were firmer. At 1534 GMT, the rand traded at 14.02 per dollar, 1.8% weaker than its close on Wednesday, and at its weakest level since December 27. The sell-off came after Gigaba said in his medium-term policy statement that the budget deficit was likely to reach 4.3% of gross domestic product in the 2017/18 fiscal year, the highest since 2009. The Treasury’s earlier estimate for the fiscal year was 3.1%, but the nation’s first recession in eight years has hurt revenue collection, while financial difficulties at state-owned firms have weighed on sentiment. “Markets have taken the budget speech badly, there are a lot of negatives in there,” said TreasuryOne currency dealer Wichard Cilliers. “They don’t like that debt to GDP is going to rise to 60% over next three years, the comments on the (South African Airways) bailout and the Eskom assistance. The R50.8 billion revenue shortfall will probably have to be financed by higher taxes next year,” he added. In fixed income, bonds weakened with the yield for the benchmark government bond rising 27.5 basis points to 9.13%. On the stock market, the benchmark Top 40 Index was up 0.5% at 51,857 points, while the broader All Share Index advanced 0.4% to 58 123 points. Companies who earn most of their revenues outside South Africa benefited from the weaker currency as it translates into higher rand-denominated profits. Global cigarette maker British American Tobacco was the best-performing blue-chip, rising 3.5% to R904. Shares in fixed-line operator Telkom fell more than 3% to a 19-month low shortly after Gigaba announced the government would sell a portion of its shares in the company. The state holds a stake of around 39% in Telkom. Telkom shares recovered in subsequent trading to end the day on R54.61, down 0.6% on Wednesday’s close.
