Platinum miner Lonmin plans to cut over 1 000 jobs before Christmas, Solidarity union said on Monday, due to persistently low commodity prices and rising costs. “Because of these cost pressures, Lonmin has decided to place a number of its marginal shafts under care and maintenance and that is the reason why the 1 139 workers will be affected,” Solidarity, which represents mainly skilled workers, said. London-listed Lonmin, whose mines are all in South Africa, is also battling a strengthening South African currency and numerous operational issues.
