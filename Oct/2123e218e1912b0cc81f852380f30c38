South Africa’s rand firmed on Wednesday, regaining ground after tumbling to its weakest in six months as the dollar’s rally stalled on speculation that US President Donald Trump’s choice for the next Federal Reserve chair could be less hawkish than expected. At 0645 GMT the rand had gained 0.44% to 13.59 per dollar compared to a close of 13.65 overnight in New York. The dollar index stepped back from a 1-1/2-month high, relieving pressure on the rand that had seen the currency selloff sharply in the past week and eventually sink to 13.77 in the previous session, its weakest level since April 10. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 3.5 basis points at 8.615%. Stocks were set to open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 futures index up 0.23%.
