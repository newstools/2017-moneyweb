Finance minister Malusi Gigaba told parliament on Wednesday that it is in the national interest for South Africa “to have influence over our connectivity to all parts of the world”, rather than to rely exclusively on profit drive scheduling of global airlines. Tabling his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) Gigaba said: “SAA sells South Africa’s economy, tourism and culture to every one of its passengers. Global airlines do not, and will not, perform this priceless marketing and branding role for us.” He said SAA, like the SABC, now has a trusted, capable board that will lead it back to healthy and sustainable operations. He said after meeting the new SAA board government will announce its plans to consolidate its aviation assets and bring in an equity partner. “We believe a strategic partner can play an important role in SAA’s turnaround, as well as unlocking value for the fiscus which has invested significantly in the airline over the years.” Government has recently given SAA R5.2 billion to pay for maturing debt and operations and will top it up to R10 billion by March 31 next year. The MTBPS warned: “There is risk that if SAA’s financial fortunes do not improve, there will be further calls on the remaining guarantee.” The remaining guarantee amounts to R15 billion. Gigaba in his speech referred to “worrying trends of governance failures, corruption, operational inefficiency and the need for government bailouts” at state-owned companies (SOCs). He said these entities are developing a poor reputation with the public at large, and have become a major fiscal risk to the country due to government guarantees of their debt. “As a shareholder we are tired of being dragged into crises by those we employ to govern and manage state-owned companies. This must end.” Gigaba said National Treasury will make proposals to government to tighten its government guarantee framework.
