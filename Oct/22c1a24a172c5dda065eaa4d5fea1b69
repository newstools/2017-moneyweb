HSBC may move fewer than 1 000 jobs to Paris following Britain’s exit from the European Union, the bank’s finance director Iain Mackay said on Monday.  “It may be less than 1 000 employees, but it’s up to 1 000,” Mackay told reporters on a conference call. Previous comments from senior HSBC executives had emphasised the number of jobs to move would be 1 000. Mackay said the bank had booked $12 million in costs for the third quarter in relation to Brexit, mostly spent on legal advice regarding contingency planning. The bank still expects to spend $200-$300 million in total on Brexit relocation costs, he said.
