SA government bonds weakened and the rand extended losses against the dollar on Tuesday after President Jacob Zuma reshuffled his cabinet. Stocks fell led by bullion shares coming under pressure on the back of a lower gold price. Zuma changed six ministers in his second cabinet reshuffle in seven months, including those for energy, home affairs, education and communications. He also axed a vocal critic of his presidency.

The rand traded at 13.45 per dollar, 1.11% weaker than its overnight close. The currency had started the session on the back foot, pressured by a stronger dollar. “The cabinet reshuffle drove bonds higher and the rand also moved slightly higher. The market is taking it slightly negative,” said Rand Merchant Bank fixed income specialist Michelle Wohlberg. Traders said the rand, like other emerging currencies, was weakened by a resurgent dollar, propped up on the day by after a report that US President Donald Trump was leaning towards picking a hawk as the next head of the Federal Reserve. Vice President of research at FXTM Jameel Ahmad said the impact of reshuffle had not been as severe as the March firing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, as investors had become “desensitised to this kind of political manoeuvring”. “I do still think political risk premium has still been priced into the rand for the time being. This might change in the run up to the ANC conference at the end of year,” said Ahmad, adding the rand was still an attractive carry trade.
