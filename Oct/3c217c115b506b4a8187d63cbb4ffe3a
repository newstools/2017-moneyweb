Around this time last month, the amount raised from initial coin offerings in the digital-currency market surpassed $2 billion. Now that sum is more than $1 billion higher.  Investors have poured in excess of $3 billion into over 200 ICOs this year, according to data from Coinschedule.com. September was among the busiest months, bringing in almost $850 million alone in 37 offerings.      October may reflect a slowdown following regulatory crackdowns in China and South Korea, though ICOs have already attracted almost $150 million so far this month. © 2017 Bloomberg
