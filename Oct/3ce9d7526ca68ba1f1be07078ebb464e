Gains in technology stocks powered by strong earnings from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet lifted the Nasdaq and the S&P on Friday, but losses in Chevron and Merck kept the Dow in the red. Microsoft advanced 6.20% after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services. Amazon jumped 8.26% and Google-parent Alphabet gained 4.26% after results. The gains drove the S&P technology index up about 2%. The sector has gained about 30% this year, double the gains in the broader S&P index. “Earnings is driving the positive sentiment at the open,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “Certainly a lot of enthusiasm for tech stocks that have reported.” As the third-quarter earnings season nears the halfway mark, 74% of the S&P companies topped expectations as of Thursday, above the 72 % beat rate for the past four quarters. Adding to the positive sentiment was a data showed the US economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth in the third-quarter, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities. The Commerce Department said GDP increased at a 3.0% annual rate in the July-September period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.5% growth. At 9:33am ET (133 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.65 points, or 0.02%, at 23 395.21, the S&P 500 was up 8.85 points, or 0.35%, at 2 569.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 72.96 points, or 1.11%, at 6 629.73. Energy stocks weighed on the S&P and the Dow. Chevron dipped 3.8% and Exxon fell 1.6% after reporting results. Merck slipped 3.5% after the company reported a fall in revenue due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs. Mattel plunged about 17% after the toymaker said it would miss its full-year revenue forecast and stop dividend from the fourth quarter. Expedia was slumped 20% after the online travel services company’s profit missed Wall Street’s consensus forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1 217 to 1 180. On the Nasdaq, 1 247 issues rose and 952 fell.
