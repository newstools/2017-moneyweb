A decade ago, Africa was regarded as one of the key geographic regions to follow. Rich in mineral resources and a fast-growing middle-class population, the continent was expected to be a key business opportunity for early pioneers. With average GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa more than halving from 3.4% in 2015 to just 1.5% in 2016, the region has witnessed its biggest economic slowdown since the 1990s and this has forced businesses to re-evaluate the opportunity on the continent and to focus on a more collaborative approach with partners and suppliers. On 9 November 2017, Moneyweb will host a roundtable breakfast in conjunction with our partners Standard Bank Business Banking looking at the opportunities for growth on the continent. Come and hear about the size of the market and how businesses are adjusting to new economic realities. When: 9 November 2017
