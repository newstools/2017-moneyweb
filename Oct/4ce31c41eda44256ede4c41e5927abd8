Former director of ConvergeNet, Hanno van Dyk, has been fined R750 000 by the Financial Services Board’s (FSB’s) enforcement committee for his role in a derivatives scandal dating back to 2008. Van Dyk was one of the directors of a number of companies that took highly-leveraged positions in their own companies’ shares using single stock futures. At the time, the JSE only required traders to hold 10% of their position in cash, which effectively allowed them to take ten times the exposure to their stock. In smaller, illiquid companies they were therefore able to take huge positions and then manipulate share prices by buying small lots of stock just before the close of trade. This was potentially highly profitable. The worst abuses at the time appear to have been committed by directors of Pinnacle Point, then called Acc-Ross. In 2015 the FSB fined company founder Jac de Beer R10 million and former CEO Jaco Verster R3 million for share price manipulation. The regulator has also imposed multi-million rand fines on the stockbrokers at Cortex Securities who facilitated the trades, as well as on directors of African Dawn and Vox Telecom. ConvergeNet The regulator has now acted against Van Dyk, also citing him on the same grounds. The FSB found that he had “manipulated the share price of ConvergeNet Holdings Limited during the period December 2008”. “The enforcement committee took several mitigating circumstances into account, including that Mr Van Dyk cooperated with the FSB during the enforcement process, accepted responsibility for the contraventions and had shown remorse for his actions,” the FSB noted. “As aggravating factors the enforcement committee took into account, amongst others, that Mr Van Dyk’s trades created an artificial price for the ConvergeNet share and undermined the integrity of the South African Financial Market.”
