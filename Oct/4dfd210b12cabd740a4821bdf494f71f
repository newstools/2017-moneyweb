In 1976 Pam Golding took the plunge and started the now-iconic real estate agency of the same name. It has since grown beyond SA’s borders to become an international company. Throughout its journey, the group’s cultural identity has grown around the founder’s qualities as well as those of a family, emphasising loyalty, commitment and perseverance.  Now 3 000-people strong, the company culture has endured and even influences the type of people who are recruited. Dr Andrew Golding, who took the helm as CEO in January 1996, talks about Pam Golding’s cultural identity in this Quick Insight video, extracted from a full-length face-to-face interview with him. Look out for the full length on October 18. In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people. The interview draws on the person’s life, failures and the lessons they have learnt on their journey to the successful leadership positions they hold today.
