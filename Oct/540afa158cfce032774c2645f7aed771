Bitcoin jumped to an all-time high above $6 300 on Tuesday, after the world’s largest futures market operator CME Group said it would launch a regulated trading venue for cryptocurrencies in the fourth quarter of 2017. The new futures contracts will be settled in cash, based on the CME ‘CF Bitcoin Reference Rate’, a once-a-day reference rate of the US dollar price of bitcoin, the company said.  The price of bitcoin jumped to as high as $6 338.60 according to trade website Coindesk’s price index, which aggregates the prices quoted across several exchanges. That was up from around $6 215 before the news. On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin jumped to as high as $6 351, up almost 4% on the day. Bitcoin has surged in value by around 555% so far this year.
