South Africa’s rand steadied against the dollar early on Monday after slumping in the previous session as political uncertainty unnerved investors, with market focus this week shifting to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s budget speech. At 0645 GMT, the rand traded at 13.66 per dollar, little changed from its New York close of 13.65 on Friday. South Africa’s rand weakened sharply on Friday, hitting its weakest since October 10, as speculation that President Jacob Zuma may axe his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa added to a climate of political uncertainty.
