South Africa’s rand inched firmer early on Thursday, helped by some investors taking profits from the dollar’s recent rally and short covering triggered by the currency approaching technical support levels. At 0630 GMT the rand was 0.1% firmer at 13.56 per dollar compared to an overnight close of 13.57 in New York. A combination of a firmer dollar, higher-than-expected inflation print and negative sentiment spurred by recent cabinet changes had pushed the rand to its weakest in nearly a week towards short term technical support around the 13.60 mark. But with the dollar at a two-week high, traders bearish on the local currency and betting on further weakness took the opportunity to “buy the dip” with a view of selling again at the next support level at 13.85. No data due in the session, so traders look ahead to treasury’s medium-term budget on October 25. A Reuters poll on Thursday expects Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to announce a revenue shortfall of R40 billion ($3.0 billion) due to poor tax receipts, likely pushing the budget deficit to 3.9% of GDP from 3.4% estimate.
