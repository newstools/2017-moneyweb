South African President Jacob Zuma’s office rejected allegations in a book that he failed to file tax returns for at least the first five years of his term and said he hasn’t benefited from receiving undeclared funds. The allegations were published in the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times newspaper this weekend, which serialized excerpts from a book called “The President’s Keepers,” written by investigative journalist Jacques Pauw. The book is being published today. “President Zuma has declared to the relevant authorities all income received and allegations contained in the reports are misleading and are clearly part of the ongoing smear campaigns,” the presidency said in an e-mailed statement. “The tax matters of the president are in order.” Investor confidence in South Africa has been dented by Zuma’s implication in a succession of scandals, including allegations that he allowed members of the wealthy Gupta family, who are in business with his son, to loot billions of rand from state companies. Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing. © 2017 Bloomberg L.P
