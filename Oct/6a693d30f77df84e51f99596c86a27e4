A decade ago, the continent of Africa was regarded as one of the key geographic regions to follow. Rich in mineral resources with a fast-growing middle class population, the continent was expected to be an ideal business opportunity for early pioneers. With average GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa more than halving from 3.4% in 2015 to just 1.5% in 2016, the region has witnessed its biggest economic slowdown since the 1990s and this has forced businesses to re-evaluate the opportunity on the continent and to focus on a more collaborative approach with partners and suppliers. In light of these developments, Moneyweb will host a roundtable breakfast on November 9 2017 in conjunction with our partners Standard Bank Business Banking focusing on opportunities for growth on the continent. Come and hear about the size of the market and how businesses are adjusting to new economic realities.
