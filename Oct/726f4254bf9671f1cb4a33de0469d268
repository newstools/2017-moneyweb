The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) said on Friday its members were ending a strike at mining and metals group South32’s aluminium smelter in Kwa-Zulu Natal province after they accepted its latest wage offer. Numsa said in a statement that its more than 600 members who had been on a week-long strike had settled for wage hikes of between 5.1% and 5.6% in the first year with increases in the second year linked to inflation, which is currently running at 4.8%.
