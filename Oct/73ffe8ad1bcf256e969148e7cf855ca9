South Africa‘s state-owned freight logistics group Transnet will invest an additional R84 billion over the next three years to increase capacity at ports and railway lines, the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) said on Wednesday. However, Transnet does not expect to meet a target of 330 million tonnes of freight rail by the end of the 2018/19 financial year, due to a domestic and global economic downturn, the DPE’s latest annual report tabled in parliament showed.
