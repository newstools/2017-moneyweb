AVI, a South African distributor of consumer goods, will stop using KPMG as an external auditor after the accounting firm admitted to falling short of its own standards when doing work for the politically connected Gupta family. “The board of AVI has considered the information relating to KPMG and certain of its past activities that is currently available to it, and has concluded that it is appropriate to give notice to KPMG,” the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement on Friday. “The termination will be effective on the close-out of all matters pertaining to the 2017 financial year-end audit.” AVI, which has a market value of R34 billion ($2.5 billion), becomes one of the largest South African companies to drop KPMG after Munich Re of Africa, Sasfin Holdings, Sygnia Asset Management and Hulisani announced they will stop using the firm’s services. The country’s biggest banks and largest insurer are also reviewing their continued use of KPMG.  Read: Wits University drops KPMG as auditor KPMG International said last month that the local business will face an independent inquiry after an internal investigation into the work done for companies associated with the Guptas.
