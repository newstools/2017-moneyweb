US stocks eked out enough gains on Monday to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite to fresh records ahead of the start of the third-quarter earnings season. A boost to corporate profit could also come from President Donald Trump’s proposed tax overhaul, hopes for which brightened last week after the US House of Representatives approved a fiscal 2018 spending blueprint to help them advance an eventual tax bill. “It appears that we have some investors follow-through with optimism on tax cuts and there was no bad news on geopolitical front,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “Given where we in the market cycle, any stress in earnings … by companies could become a speed bump.” With the stock market rallying for most of the year, the valuations for many stocks have risen above their long-term averages, and strong earnings reports would help justify those premiums.
