South African construction firm Group Five said on Monday that Greenbay Properties has made an unsolicited to acquire its European assets and businesses for R1.6 billion ($120 million). The offer values Group Five’s assets at 60 percent more than the company’s market capitalisation of around R1 billion, suggesting that its assets in South Africa, where the economy is barely growing, are not highly rated. “Group Five has constituted an independent board to consider the terms and conditions, as well as the merits, of the offer,” the company said in a statement.
