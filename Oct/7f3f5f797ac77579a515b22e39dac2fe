South Africa’s rand was a touch weaker in early trade on Wednesday, on the backfoot against a firming dollar and negative sentiment spurred by another cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma. At 0630 GMT the rand had weakened 0.11% to 13.41 per dollar compared to a close of 13.40 overnight in New York. The rand fell to a low of 13.47 in the previous session after some quick selling after Zuma changed six ministers in his second cabinet reshuffle in seven months.
