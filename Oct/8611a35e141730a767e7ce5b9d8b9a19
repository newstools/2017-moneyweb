South African President Jacob Zuma’s spokesman said on Friday there was no basis for reports that the country’s leader would axe his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, speculation about which has weighed on the currency and bonds. “It’s rumours and gossip and we don’t comment on them at all,” Zuma’s spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga told Reuters. Asked in parliament on Thursday whether he might be sacked, Ramaphosa, a frontrunner in December’s African National Congress leadership contest, declined to speculate but said if so, he would accept the president’s decision. Ramaphosa, a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon, is viewed as the most likely rival candidate to Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the former chairwoman of the African Union, who is Zuma’s pick for the leadership and is the president’s ex-wife. He has recently stepped up criticism of Zuma’s scandal-plagued government. Trade union federation Cosatu and the South African Communist Party (SACP), both partners in the ANC’s ruling alliance, have endorsed him for the top post. South Africa will elect a new president in 2019. Zuma irked some within the alliance on Tuesday by sacking a minister belonging to the SACP. His second cabinet reshuffle in seven months also saw a close associate given the energy portfolio as his government tries to push through a big nuclear deal. Speculation that Zuma may remove Ramaphosa, who was the ANC’s chief negotiator during the 1990s transition from apartheid, weighed on the rand and bonds, which underperformed emerging market peers on Friday versus a firmer dollar.
