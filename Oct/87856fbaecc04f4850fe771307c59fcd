 Coca-Cola reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter as North America sales rose 3% on higher demand for Sprite, tea and coffee.  The company said it was gaining market-share against rivals, echoing sector analysts’ views ahead of the results that it was eating into the sales of arch rival PepsiCo. While the Coca-Cola’s overall volume sales in North America remained flat in the third quarter, Sprite sales rose in the mid-single digits and tea and coffee sales increased in the low-single digits. Diet Coke sales were down. PepsiCo this month reported a drop in quarterly beverage sales in North America for the first time in two years, hit by weak demand for Gatorade and marketing missteps.  Coca-Cola is gaining share from rival Pepsi due to better performance in the territories it has franchised to bottlers and a more aggressive push in the non-carbonated drink business, RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi wrote in a pre-earnings note. Coca-Cola has also been cutting costs, including by the refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations and reducing workforce. Cost of goods sold fell 18% in the quarter, and general and selling expenses dropped 20%. Net income attributable to Coca-Cola’s shareholders rose to $1.45 billion, or 33 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 29, from $1.05 billion, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. [nBwgSl57a] Excluding items, the company earned a profit of 50 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 49 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 14.6% to $9.08 billion as the company refranchised some bottling operations, but beat the average estimate of $8.72 billion.
