Ordinary South Africans have a lot on their minds and with everything going on around us, it’s easy to forget that we need a savings plan that will help us meet our retirement goals.  Moneyweb, in conjunction with our partners Liberty, have teamed up once again to deliver the Retire Well Masterclass. Bringing together some of the top financial minds in the country, this Retire Well Masterclass will help you identify strategies to implement for a stable and secure financial retirement.  The event is to be held on November 9 at Summer Place in Sandton and you can book tickets here.  Moneyweb editor Ryk van Niekerk shares more information in this video.
