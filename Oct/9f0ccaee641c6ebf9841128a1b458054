As bitcoin approaches yet another record, Union Square Ventures’s Fred Wilson says investors should be careful how much of their portfolios are allocated to digital currencies. Wilson, who first invested in the sector in 2013, wants to set the record straight on exactly what percentage of someone’s investments should be tied to things like bitcoin. “I have about five percent of our net worth in crypto assets, across a number of vehicles; direct holdings, Union Square funds, token funds, etc.,” Wilson said in a blog post. “I think that’s likely at the high end of what the average person should have, but I also think its not a ridiculous number for the average person to have.”      If someone had invested in bitcoin the same day that Wilson announced his venture capital firm’s investment in Coinbase, a trading platform for cryptocurrencies, they would have seen their investment rise a whopping 5 000%. Here’s a look at how much a few different types of investor should have tied to cryptocurrencies, according to Wilson: © 2017 Bloomberg
