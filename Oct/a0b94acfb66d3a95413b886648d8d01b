South Africa’s rand was a touch weaker in early deals on Tuesday, as investors refrained from making any large moves ahead of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba budget speech. At 0800 GMT, the rand traded at 13.72 versus the dollar, 0.18% softer from its New York close overnight. Gigaba will deliver his first medium-term budget policy statement in Parliament on Wednesday. A Reuters poll found poor tax receipts could push the 2017/18 budget deficit forecast to 3.9% of GDP from an estimate of 3.1% in February. Stocks were little changed, with the JSE Top-40 index at 51 651, not far from record high of 51 915 set last week. Government bonds were also flat, and the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 up 1 basis points to 8.850%.
