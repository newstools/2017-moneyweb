South Africa’s rand was firmer early on Thursday, extending a rally to its best level in nearly two weeks against the dollar with sentiment over economic growth soothed by recent data helping to boost demand for the currency. At 0650 GMT the rand had firmed 0.5% to 13.46 per dollar compared to an overnight close of 13.52, with less hawkish than expected minutes from the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting keeping bids for emerging currencies strong. The World Bank kept its estimate of 0.6% growth in 2017 in its sub-Saharan report on Wednesday, while mining production data later in the session is expected to show the sector remains in growth territory.
