The rand retreated on Tuesday, erasing the previous session’s gains despite the country showing an eighth consecutive monthly trade surplus, as dollar resumed its rally following positive employment data and gold prices stumbled. At 1445 GMT the rand was 0.78% weaker at 14.18 per dollar compared to close of 14.07 overnight in New York. The local unit had traded marginally firmer early in the session but surrendered momentum after US consumer confidence rose to a nearly 17-year high and employment improved, lifting the greenback against and putting emerging assets under strain. Gold, a major source of export revenue for South Africa, also suffered on the day, with spot gold slipping by 0.5% to $1 269.69 an ounce by 1424 GMT. Traders said the rand was suffering short-selling having breached the 14.15 short-term support and was now poised to fall further. Data on the day, showing South Africa recorded a trade surplus in September, albeit narrower than August at R4 billion, failed to turn the tide against the rand. Bonds were also weaker with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 adding 2 basis points to 9.105%. Stocks edged up after again hitting record highs in line with Asian peers such as South Korea, but gains remain constrained by technical factors. The benchmark Top 40 Index added 0.17% to 52 570.20 after earlier hitting a life high of 52 651.39. The wider All Share Index rose 0.17% to 58 980.11. Earlier in the session it punctured the 59 000 level for the first time. But the 14-day RSI – a momentum indicator tracked by analysts – for both indices remains deeply in overbought territory, suggesting the market could soon be in for a correction at these levels. The market’s record run has largely been driven by a handful of blue chips such as e-commerce giant Naspers, which gets most of its earnings from offshore, highlighting the market’s disconnect with South Africa’s slow-growth economy,
