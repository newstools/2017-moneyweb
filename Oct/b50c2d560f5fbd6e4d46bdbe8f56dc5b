President Jacob Zuma has made changes to his cabinet again.  In a statement on Tuesday, the presidency announced that big changes would be made in the higher education and training, energy and home affairs departments.  This is the second cabinet reshuffle this year, after Zuma’s wide changes to the national executive in March that saw the axing of former Minster of Finance Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.  The presidency said the following changes would be made to the national executive: Ministers appointed in their new portfolios after Zuma’s cabinet reshuffle in March included Dlodlo (appointed as Minister of Communications replacing Faith Muthambi) and Kubayi (appointed as Minister of Energy replacing Tina Joemat-Pettersson). They were appointed in their respective cabinet portfolios for seven months.  Despite mounting speculation, presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was not included in the national executive. In September, Dlamini-Zuma was sworn in as an MP.   The appointment of Zuma’s ally Mahlobo as the Minster of Energy is largely viewed by commentators as the next step to push through the R1-trillion nuclear deal. The rand weakened by 0.52% against the dollar after the cabinet reshuffle announcement. The rand fell through R13.40/$ during intra-day trade.    Business Unity South Africa (Busa) said it was concerned about lack of stability in key departments, including energy and home affairs, as certainty was a prerequisite for business confidence. “Political and economic stability is required to ignite inclusive economic growth and generate much-needed employment and revenue to pursue our social goals,” Busa CEO Tanya Cohen said in a statement. “This latest reshuffle further undermines prospects for SA’s growth.”
