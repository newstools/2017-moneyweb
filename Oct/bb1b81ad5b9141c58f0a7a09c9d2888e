White farmers own almost three-quarters of South Africa’s agricultural land, even after 23 years of government efforts to redistribute land to the black majority, City Press reported, citing a land audit by farm lobbying group Agri SA. Some 73.3% of agricultural land is owned by whites, down from 85.1% in 1994, the year South Africa first held democratic elections, the newspaper reported. Black ownership has increased markedly in some of the country’s most fertile provinces. Black farmers own 74% of the land in KwaZulu-Natal and 52% in Limpopo, City Press reported, citing the report to be released this week. Total acreage available for farming fell 4% over the 23 years reviewed, as mining and expanding municipalities took over agricultural land, according to economist Johann Bornman, who conducted the audit for the lobbying group. © 2017 Bloomberg L.P
