Ratings agency Moody’s said on Monday that the medium-term budget statement presented by South African finance minister Malusi Gigaba last week was credit negative, as it signalled a departure from fiscal consolidation efforts. Gigaba shocked markets on October 25 by flagging sharply weaker growth expectations, wider deficits and rising government debt in a closely watched budget speech. “In our view, unless the government presents a credible fiscal consolidation plan in the February 2018 budget, debt sustainability is at risk,” Moody’s analyst for South Africa Zuzana Brixiova said in a statement.
