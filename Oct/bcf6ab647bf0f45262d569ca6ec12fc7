The total assets managed by the world’s 500 biggest fund houses hit an all-time high of $81.2 trillion in 2016, research showed on Monday, a 5.8% increase on the previous year. Although a comfortable majority of funds are still actively managed, the research from advisory firm Willis Towers Watson showed, the proportion of passively managed funds climbed to 21.6%. That was up from 20.3% the previous year, and from 16.5% five years ago. “We expect that this trend will continue to put downward pressure on traditional fee structures, particularly among active managers seeking to remain competitive and to maximise value to investors,” said Willis Towers Watson’s global head of manager research, Luba Nikulina. US fund managers saw their assets increase 7.7% to $47.4 trillion, while European managers saw a 2.8% increase, to $25.8 trillion. UK-based fund management firms saw their assets fall for a second straight year, however, by 4.5% to $6.3 trillion. BlackRock remained the top fund manager, with $5.1 trillion under management, followed by fellow US firm Vanguard, with just under $4 trillion.
