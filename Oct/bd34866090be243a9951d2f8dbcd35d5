Initial shipments of Apple’s new iPhone X will total 20 million units this year, Japanese news service Nikkei reported, without saying how it got the information. That is only about half the total number analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities had forecast the company would be able to ship in 2017.   Apple shares fell 1% in Frankfurt on the news. Nikkei said Apple is struggling to solve technical issues with parts of the phone that support its new face authentication feature. The report said Apple had already begun negotiations with other suppliers to make the problematic components. Apple declined to provide a comment for this story. Earlier on Tuesday AMS, an Austrian-based electronic components company that is an Apple supplier, released sales forecasts that analysts interpreted as an indication fears about weak shipments of the iPhone X were misplaced. Both AMS and Dialog Semiconductor pared gains following the Nikkei report. © 2017 Bloomberg
