The retail price of petrol and the wholesale price of diesel in South Africa will increase from Wednesday due to a weakening of the rand against the dollar, the energy department said on Sunday. The price of petrol will rise by 4 cents to 14.05 rand per litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while that of diesel will go up by 23 cents to 12.35 rand.Â
