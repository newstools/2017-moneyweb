African Bank announced on Wednesday that Brian Riley has informed the board that he intends to step down as CEO of the group effective March 31, 2018. According to the statement, Riley has accepted an invitation to remain on the board as a director from April 1, 2018.  Riley joined African Bank as CEO designate on May 1, 2015 and assumed the role of CEO of the newly restructured group when the bank launched on April 4, 2016.  “Brian was instrumental in refocusing and overseeing the establishment of the strategic platform for the group,” notes chairman Louis von Zeuner.  A potential successor to Riley, Basani Maluleke, was identified earlier in the year and was appointed onto the executive team on July 3. The process of inducting Basani has been underway over the past few months. Basani has been a board member of the African Bank Group since July 2015.  Says Riley: “I am delighted with the progress we have made and although my role will change from April next year, I remain convinced that the path we have chosen is the right one and more importantly, that we have the right people in place to achieve our ambitious goal be a highly respected South African retail bank.” African Bank also announced that Ignatius Sehoole, a director on the board, has resigned to pursue alternate interests.
