Wall Street indexes hovered at record levels on Monday as investors cheered the continuation of “Abenomics” following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s emphatic win in the weekend polls. The market has had a strong run, with the Dow breaking the 23 000 milestone last week on strong earnings. Stocks also got a boost on Friday after the Senate passed a budget resolution, lifting hopes that President Donald Trump’s tax plans may move forward. Corporate earnings have got off to a strong start, with nearly three quarter of the 88 S&P companies beating profit expectations. “Investors are being cheered on by the global markets after the Japanese election,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “The strength continues based on the prospect of fiscal reform and good earnings.” World stocks were lifted to an all-time high after Abe’s victory raised hopes of continued market friendly monetary policies and economic reforms. The top Senate Republican and the White House budget director said on Sunday they hoped for action on the new tax package by the end of the year, while keeping their options open on how to pay for sweeping tax cuts. Investors are also waiting for news on the next Federal Reserve chief. Trump said he would make his choice to lead the Fed soon and was still considering at least three people: Fed governor Jerome Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor and Yellen.
