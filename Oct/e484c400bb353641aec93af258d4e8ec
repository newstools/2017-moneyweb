Pilots at South Africa’s Mango, a low-cost airline owned by state-run national carrier South African Airways, on Friday reported for work ending a four-day strike, the union representing most of the pilots said. The airline granted pilots a 7% salary hike and agreed to table an agreement outlining flight scheduling and hours of work within six months, trade union Solidarity said in a statement.
