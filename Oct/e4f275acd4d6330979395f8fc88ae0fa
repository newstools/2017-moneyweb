The probability of South Africa being hit with further credit rating downgrades is “quite significant,” deputy central bank governor Kuben Naidoo said on Tuesday while addressing a monetary policy forum in Cape Town. Fitch and S&P Global Ratings both downgraded South Africa’s foreign-currency rating to speculative grade, or junk, following an abrupt cabinet reshuffle in March that saw the respected Pravin Gordhan axed as finance minister by President Jacob Zuma. Naidoo added that the frail state of the economy stemmed almost exclusively from domestic factors. Africa‘s most industrialised economy would likely grow 0.6% or 0.7% in 2017 and inflation should remain within the 3% to 6% percent target range for the next two years. When speaking on the KPMG scandal Naidoo said that the global accountancy firm must be given space to “come clean” via an independent investigative process.
