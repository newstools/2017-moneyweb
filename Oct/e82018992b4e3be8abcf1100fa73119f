Over the 12 months to the end of June this year, the South African equity market was very depressed. The S&P South Africa Domestic Shareholder Weighted (DSW) Index was 0.1% down over this period. This was a difficult environment in which to be a fund manager, but at the same time it was one in which active strategies should have been able to prove their value. In a market going sideways, one would hope that good stock pickers would be able to extract something for their clients above what the index was offering. To some extent, this did play out in South Africa. The latest S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) Scorecard released on Tuesday shows that 44.97% of local active managers beat the S&P benchmark over this one year period. This was a significant improvement from just 27.53% for the 12 months to the end of December 2016. However, that does still mean that the majority of managers underperformed. Overall, 55.03% of managers produced returns below the benchmark. As the table below indicates, this also increases substantially over longer periods. Over both three and five years, more than four fifths of active managers lag the index.

It also indicates how difficult it is for investors to pick one that will. If only 16.38% of active fund managers beat the index over five years, that leaves very little margin for error. This is also apparent when comparing the average equity fund performance against the respective benchmarks: Average South African equity fund performance Category 1 year % 3 year % (annualised) 5 year % (annualised) S&P South Africa DSW Index -0.10% 5.05% 12.97% South African Equity -0.85% 2.26% 10.17% Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices Average global equity fund performance Category 1 year % 3 year % (annualised) 5 year % (annualised) S&P Global 1200 Index 6.80% 13.57% 22.92% Global Equity 6.05% 9.51% 18.77% Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices These figures do however improve significantly on an asset-weighted average. In other words, the average larger fund performed better than the average small fund. This doesn’t mean that smaller funds can’t or didn’t outperform. A number of them did. What it shows is that investors without in-depth knowledge or expertise are better off choosing a larger fund.

In this space, a comfortable majority of active managers outperform.
