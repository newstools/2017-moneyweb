South African maize farmers intend to plant 6% less hectares of the staple grain in the 2017/2018 season, after a bumper harvest depressed prices, the official Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Thursday. Farmers are expected to plant 2.470 million hectares of maize next season compared to 2.629 million hectares planted last season when yields were boosted by favourable weather conditions. The CEC forecast, which was 13% more than a Reuters poll of 2.176 million hectares, consisted of 1.404 million hectares of the staple white maize and 1.066 million hectares of the yellow variety used mainly in animal feed. “The decrease can be mainly attributed to the lower prices, huge carry-over stocks and profitability issues,” the CEC said The bumper 2016/2017 crop has kept maize prices depressed which is expected to prompt farmers to plant more profitable crops such as yellow maize and oilseeds suck as soya beans and sunflower seeds next season. The CEC estimated that farmers will plant 25.4% more soya beans at 720 000 hectares and 4.7% more sunflower seeds at 665 500 hectares compared with the previous season The white maize futures contract due in March closed at R2 070 on Thursday was down 61% from its peak of R5 376 a tonne hit in January last year following a drought.
