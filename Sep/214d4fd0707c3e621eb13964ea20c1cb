South African online marketplace bidorbuy.co.za is offering up Apple’s newest release for purchase to local early adopters. Five iPhone 8 devices are currently featured in bidorbuy’s Deal of the Week, which is a regular online sale event reserved for new products. According to the online trading platform, Deal of the Week is also the place where buyers can find the latest and the most desirable high-tech devices that may not yet be available in the South African market. “Thanks to our sellers, South Africans are able to get their hands on the newest model of the Apple iPhone locally and have it delivered to their doorstep by a courier,” says bidorbuy CEO Jaco Jonker. Past experience with “the first in South Africa” iPhone models shows that South Africans are ready to pay a premium price for the privilege of owning the latest release before (practically) anyone else in the country. The iPhone 8 is listed on bidorbuy for R18 299. If they are ready to fork out R19 499, buyers can opt for the iPhone 8 Plus. Both models come with 256GB capacity and both will be shipped nationally free of charge. Buyers can choose between gold and space grey colour. The manufacturer’s recommended selling price is $849 for iPhone 256GB and $949 for iPhone Plus 256GB, excluding local taxes. The South African release date for iPhone 8 is not known, nor is the price. The five units on bidorbuy’s Deal of the Week will be available for purchase until midnight 1 October. Apple announced that a third new model, iPhone X, will hit the market soon. “We also hope to be the first in South Africa to have this up for sale when Apple releases it in November this year,” Jonker says.
