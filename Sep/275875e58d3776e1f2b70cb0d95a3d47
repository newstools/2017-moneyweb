In this episode of TechCentral, Duncan McLeod chats via Skype to Gerrit Smit, fund manager at London-based wealth management company Stonehage Fleming, which invests billions of dollars on behalf of ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Thirty percent of Stonehage Fleming’s Global Best Ideas (GBI) Fund is made up of investments in the technology space, including in companies such as Visa, PayPal, Tencent and Accenture. Smit, who is head of the equities management team, has overall responsibility for the business unit, along with its portfolio management and equity research functions. He joined Stonehage Fleming in 2008 after 25 years of investment experience as equities analyst, chief investment strategist and chief investment officer for Sanlam’s international portfolios in London, and heading a boutique fund manager’s investment research. In the podcast, Smit explains why he believes there’s still plenty of upside for some of the world’s biggest tech stocks, despite the strong rally they’ve enjoyed in recent years. But what are the best metrics for determining whether these shares still make good investments or not? Smit explains why he focuses on top-line growth and on free cash flow, in particular. Listen to the podcast to hear Smit’s views on tech giants such as Tencent, Naspers, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Tesla and why he believes the tech rally of recent years still has plenty of legs. <a href="http://iono.fm/e/478594">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> This podcast originally featured on TechCentral.
