In 2009 Yusuf Randera-Rees had R60 000 in his pocket, Harvard and Oxford degrees in his head, and a highly unusual concept of how to make large-scale systemic impact on unemployment – by identifying South Africa’s world class talent among micro-entrepreneurs who find themselves trapped in the informal sector.  Along the way, as he and his co-founder established a company that has raised hundreds of millions of rands to invest in a vision ‘…to build a global society where everyone is capable of reaching their full entrepreneurial potential’, he learnt about how entrepreneurship is at an amazing intersection between leadership and economics.  To date Awethu has facilitated support for 2 000 entrepreneurs, driven the creation of over 2 000 jobs and has raised over R450 million to invest in their mission to build a fair South Africa through entrepreneurship.  In this face-to-face video interview Randera-Rees shares his refreshing thinking and unusual insights – gained along the way as Awethu creates a new kind of leadership that empowers ordinary South Africans. In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people. The interview draws on the person’s life, failures and the lessons they have learnt on their journey to the successful leadership positions they hold today.
