The share price of building materials logistics group Distribution and Warehousing Network (DAWN) jumped by more than 21% by midday on Thursday after news of a deal that will leave DAWN debt-free.This follows a 63% drop in the share price in the year to date.DAWN CEO Edwin Hewitt told Moneyweb from Japan, where he was for the signing of the agreement that the buyer, Japan-based LIXIL s investment in South Africa, will not end with the R325 million purchase price. The group will also bring new technology and skills to Grohe DAWN Watertech (GDWT) which will unlock growth into sub-Saharan markets.GDWT is an investment holding company for a group of companies. The GDWT Group manufactures and supplies taps, mixers, sanitary ware and related plumbing accessories, operating principally in South Africa with export customers in sub-Saharan Africa, Mauritius, the Middle East and South America.The deal entails the sale of DAWN s 49% stake in GDWT to LIXIL that currently holds the controlling stake for R324.5 million.Hewitt said this will unburden DAWN from its onerous debt and interest payments and give it space to proceed with implementing its turnaround strategy aimed at a return to profitability.DAWN will remain in its current role as master distributor of GDWT products in South Africa, Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia, Lesotho, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Seychelles, Rwanda, Ghana, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. DAWN said in a statement that LIXIL is one of the largest global companies in the housing and building industry. It is the controlling shareholder of GDWT, and indirectly owns 51% of the GDWT shares through Grohe, an indirect wholly-owned LIXIL subsidiary.After settling the capital gains tax arising from the sale, DAWN intends to use the transaction proceeds to repay the group s existing R200 million debt, rendering the group debt free. The remaining proceeds will be reinvested in the core master distribution operations of the group, now reported as DAWN Trading under the group s new reporting structure announced in its final results, the group said in a statement.The execution date of the transaction is 14 September and, pending the fulfilment of suspensive conditions, share transfer should take place in December.GDWT comprises the South African brassware and tap manufacturer and supplier Cobra, assembler of imported components for brass taps and mixers ISCA, Libra bath manufacturer, Vaal sanitary ware supplier, valve manufacturer Apex and Exipro, which specialises in the manufacture of brass products used in the plumbing market (tap and valve bodies) and manufactures rubber waste traps.
