A former joint venture partner of Steinhoff has asked a Dutch court to order an investigation into the South African group&#8217;s annual accounts, which Steinhoff said it expected to be dismissed.The petition by OM Handels GmbH and MW Handels GmbH (OM &amp; MW), owned by the former joint venture partner, comes after German prosecutors said last month they were investigating four current and former executives of Steinhoff for suspected accounting fraud.Steinhoff, Europe&#8217;s second-largest furniture retailer after IKEA, said in a statement on Monday the petition by OM &amp; MW related to a joint investment that was eventually consolidated by Steinhoff in its books.&#8220;Steinhoff has appointed legal and external audit firms in Germany to investigate the matter independently. They have concluded that no evidence exists of any wrongdoing,&#8221; Steinhoff said.Chief executive Markus Jooste said in the statement that allegations brought against Steinhoff were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and the group&#8217;s 2016 annual accounts were correct.The Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal has scheduled a hearing for Thursday.
