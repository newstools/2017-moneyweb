That South Africa and the world is in bad shape is apparent in the colossal global inequality that exists between rich and poor.The national status quo is not showing any signs of improvement, with the latest revelation that three in every five South Africans are living in poverty. That s a staggering 30 million people or 55% of our population.South Africa s problems are compounded by the devastating effects of a lack of ethical leadership, which is evident in the continued allegations of corruption and state capture against state President Jacob Zuma in his dealings with the Gupta family, who are widely believed to have exerted undue political influence in furthering their private business interests.It is virtually impossible to suppress the nagging apprehension about the ability or political will of national leadership to find suitable remedies for the ills that currently plague South Africa.It is also clear that, given the state of inertia, the ramifications on the citizens of South Africa are either ignored or underestimated. Values-driven leadership plays a critical role in building stable, functional societies and, without it, there is a serious threat to social order.This is why it is critical now, more than ever, that business schools rethink the role they play in developing ethical leaders for both the public and private sector.We need to develop leadership capabilities and a moral framework that will put us on a different path. Our country is not short of tremendous talent and moral fibre. We have it within us to determine our own fate as a nation.Research-based higher education entities need to influence business leadership, business behaviour and the role of business in society through the kind of value systems we are trying to achieve. Business school students tend to occupy senior management and executive roles and are therefore able to influence key decisions taken within their organisations and the broader society.They are the ones who could drive a more humanising economy and a new capitalism , which serves the needs of the people.For a business, or government for that matter, to be sustainable in the long run, human investment is critical. The economy must serve the many, not the few; because these people are not just your workers, they are also your customers and voters.By inculcating a business school s curriculum with these kinds of values, it could go a long way towards influencing business behaviour in general.Critical introspection is needed and business schools must revisit their modes of research, engagement, learning and teaching to see where they can provide better support in the field of business education and values-driven, ethical leadership.This lesson was made clear to me when our business school was recently rebranded as the Nelson Mandela University Business School. More than a name change, it was an identification with the values of ethical governance associated with our former president and namesake.This is more than just a business decision to trade on the global capital of the name; it involves a responsibility to remain relevant to the needs of both business and society at large.This sets a high standard for academic staff and students of our 10-year-old institution. With the adoption of those values, we are charged as graduates, as employees, as alumni and ambassadors to change the world for the better by remaining on the cutting edge of knowledge production and research.While business schools must have a core focus on the business of doing business, they must also shape leaders who understand that economic progress and the pursuit of individual financial prosperity must be done in a way that benefits the greater society. Ultimately, it is about connecting business success with social progress.Dr Randall Jonas is director of the Nelson Mandela University Business School.
