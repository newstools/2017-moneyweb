In 2009 Harvard and Oxford graduate Yusuf Randera-Rees, and his partner Ryan Pakter, started the Awethu Project with a modest R60 000 – however their vision was everything but modest. In fact it was huge. Their aim was to make a large-scale systemic impact on the country’s economy by elevating entrepreneurs who are trapped in the informal sector.  How Awethu became a company with hundreds of millions of rands to invest in this vision, is both a fascinating and inspiring story. To date Awethu has facilitated support for 2 000 entrepreneurs, driven the creation of over 2 000 jobs and has raised over R450 million to invest in their mission to build a fair South Africa through entrepreneurship.  In this Quick Insight, extracted from a full length face-to-face video interview with Randera-Rees, he shares his unique view of the kind of entrepreneurial leadership that can realistically transform South Africa.  Keep an eye out for the full length interview, due to be published on September 13 2017.  In partnership with FNB, Moneyweb presents this bespoke leadership video series with top business people.
